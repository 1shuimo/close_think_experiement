Okay, let's try to solve this problem. The question is asking for the largest possible real part of the expression (75 - 117i)z + (96 + 144i)/z, where z is a complex number with |z| = 4. Hmm, so z has magnitude 4. 

First, I remember that when dealing with complex numbers and their magnitudes, sometimes it's helpful to express them in polar form. Since |z| = 4, we can write z as 4e^{iθ}, where �� is the argument of z. That might simplify things because then 1/z would be 1/(4e^{iθ}) = (1/4)e^{-iθ}. 

Let me write that down. Let z = 4e^{iθ}. Then 1/z = (1/4)e^{-iθ}. So substituting into the expression:

(75 + 117i) * 4e^{iθ} + (96 + 144i) * (1/4)e^{-iθ}.

Simplify the coefficients:

First term: 4*(75 + 117i) = 300 + 468i.

Second term: (96 + 144i)/4 = 24 + 36i.

So the expression becomes (300 + 468i)e^{iθ} + (24 + 36i)e^{-iθ}.

Now, I need to find the real part of this expression. Let me denote A = 300 + 468i and B = 24 + 36i. Then the expression is A e^{iθ} + B e^{-iθ}. The real part of this would be Re(A e^{iθ} + B e^{-iθ}).

To compute this, I can expand each term using Euler's formula. Let's recall that e^{iθ} = cosθ + i sinθ, and e^{-iθ} = cosθ - i sinθ. 

So, A e^{iθ} = (300 + 468i)(cosθ + i sinθ). Similarly, B e^{-iθ} = (24 + 36i)(cosθ - i sinθ). 

Let me compute the real parts of each term. For the first term, the real part is 300 cosθ - 468 sinθ. For the second term, the real part is 24 cosθ + 36 sinθ. Adding these together gives the total real part:

(300 cosθ - 468 sinθ) + (24 cosθ + 36 sinθ) = (300 + 24) cosθ + (-468 + 36) sinθ = 324 cosθ - 432 sinθ.

So the problem reduces to finding the maximum value of 324 cosθ - 432 sinθ. 

This is a standard problem of finding the maximum of a linear combination of sine and cosine. The maximum value of a cosθ + b sinθ is sqrt(a² + b²). Wait, but here it's 324 cosθ - 432 sinθ. So the maximum would be sqrt(324² + (-432)^2). Let me compute that.

First, compute 324 squared. 324^2: 300^2 = 90000, 24^2 = 576, and cross term 2*300*24 = 14400. So (300 + 24)^2 = 90000 + 14400 + 576 = 104,976. Wait, but 324 is 300 + 24, so yes, 324^2 = 104,976. 

Then (-432)^2 is 432^2. Let's compute 400^2 = 160,000, 32^2 = 1024, and cross term 2*400*32 = 25,600. So (400 + 32)^2 = 160,000 + 25,600 + 1,024 = 186,624. 

Adding 104,976 + 186,624 = 291,600. The square root of 291,600 is sqrt(291600). Let me see: 500^2 = 250,000, 540^2 = 291,600. Yes, because 540*540 = (500 + 40)^2 = 500^2 + 2*500*40 + 40^2 = 250,000 + 40,000 + 1,600 = 291,600. So sqrt(291,600) = 540. 

Therefore, the maximum real part is 540. 

Wait, but let me double-check. The formula is that the maximum of a cosθ + b sinθ is sqrt(a² + b²). Here, a is 324 and b is -432. So yes, the maximum is sqrt(324² + (-432)^2) = 540. So the answer should be 540. 

But let me make sure I didn't make any mistakes in the earlier steps. Let me retrace. 

Original expression: (75 + 117i)z + (96 + 144i)/z. With |z|=4. 

Expressed z as 4e^{iθ}, so 1/z is (1/4)e^{-iθ}. Then multiplied out:

(75 + 117i)*4 e^{iθ} + (96 + 144i)/4 e^{-iθ} = (300 + 468i)e^{iθ} + (24 + 36i)e^{-iθ}. 

Then taking real parts: 

For (300 + 468i)(cosθ + i sinθ), the real part is 300 cosθ - 468 sinθ. 

For (24 + 36i)(cosθ - i sinθ), the real part is 24 cosθ + 36 sinθ. 

Adding them gives 324 cosθ - 432 sinθ. 

Yes, that seems correct. Then the maximum of that expression is indeed 540. 

Therefore, the largest possible real part is 540. 

But wait, let me check if there's another approach. Maybe using complex analysis or optimization. 

Alternatively, since |z|=4, we can let z = 4e^{iθ}, then the expression becomes (75 + 117i) * 4e^{iθ} + (96 + 144i)/4 * e^{-iθ} = 4*(75 + 117i) e^{iθ} + (24 + 36i) e^{-iθ}. 

Which is the same as before. Then combining terms, the real part is 324 cosθ - 432 sinθ. 

So the maximum is sqrt(324² + 432²). Wait, but 324 and 432 have a common factor. Let me see: 324 is 81*4, 432 is 108*4. Wait, 324 = 81*4? 81*4 is 324? 80*4=320, 1*4=4, so yes. 432 is 108*4. So sqrt( (81*4)^2 + (108*4)^2 ) = 4*sqrt(81² + 108²). 

Compute 81² + 108². 81² is 6561, 108² is 11664. Sum is 6561 + 11664 = 18225. sqrt(18225) is 135. So 4*135 = 540. Yep, same result. 

So that's another way to see it. So the maximum is indeed 540. 

Therefore, the answer should be 540.

I may be uncertain here, so I will briefly re-check only the most recent local steps, verify math, logic, signs, and units, make only minimal fixes, and continue exactly from this point by finishing the interrupted sentence or step immediately before this injected <think> without restarting or repeating earlier long text, while strictly keeping the required output format. Let me start thinking. I will now close this thinking block and continue from the interrupted point. I must not rephrase prior output, and must preserve the required output format. I will now close this thinking block with exactly one <tool_response>.
