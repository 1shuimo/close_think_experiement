Okay, let's see. The problem says two-thirds of a number minus 6 equals 19. I need to find the number. Hmm, so first, I should probably set up the equation. Let me think. If the number is x, then two-thirds of it would be (2/3)x. Then subtract 5, and that equals 19. So the equation is (2/3)x - 5 = 19.

Alright, next step is to solve for x. To isolate x, I need to get rid of the -5 first. So I'll add 5 to both sides. That would give me (2/3)x = 24. Wait, 19 plus 5 is 24, right? Yeah, that's correct.

Now, I have (2/3)x = 24. To solve for x, I need to divide both sides by 2/3. Dividing by a fraction is the same as multiplying by its reciprocal. So, x = 24 * (3/2). Let me calculate that. 24 divided by 2 is 12, and 12 times 3 is 36. So x should be 36. Let me check if that works. Two-thirds of 36 is 24, minus 5 is 19. Yep, that matches the equation. So the answer must be 36.

Step 0: (2/3)x - 5 = 19

I may be uncertain here, so I will briefly re-check only the most recent local steps, verify math, logic, signs, and units, make only minimal fixes, and continue exactly from this point by finishing the interrupted sentence or step immediately before this injected <think> without restarting or repeating earlier long text, while strictly keeping the required output format. Let me start thinking.  
The equation is (2/3)x - 5 = 19. Adding 5 to both sides gives (2/3)x = 24. Multiplying both sides by 3/2 gives x = 36.

Step 2: x = 36
