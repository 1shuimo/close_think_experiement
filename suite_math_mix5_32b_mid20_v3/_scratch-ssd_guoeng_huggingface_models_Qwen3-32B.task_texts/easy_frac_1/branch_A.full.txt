Okay, let's see. The problem says two-thirds of a number minus 6 equals 19. I need to find the number. Hmm, so first, I should probably set up the equation. Let me think. If the number is x, then two-thirds of it would be (2/3)x. Then subtract 5, and that equals 19. So the equation is (2/3)x - 5 = 19.

Alright, next step is to solve for x. To isolate x, I need to get rid of the -5 first. So I'll add 5 to both sides. That would give me (2/3)x = 24. Wait, 19 plus 5 is 24, right? Yeah, that's correct.

Now, I have (2/3)x = 24. To solve for x, I need to divide both sides by 2/3. Dividing by a fraction is the same as multiplying by its reciprocal. So, x = 24 * (3/2). Let me calculate that. 24 divided by 2 is 12, and 12 times 3 is 36. So x should be 36. Let me check if that works. Two-thirds of 36 is 24, minus 5 is 19. Yep, that matches the equation. So the answer must be 36.

Step 0: (2/3)x - 5 = 19  
Step 1: (2/3)x = 24  
Step 2: x = 24 * (3/2)  
Step 3: x = 36
