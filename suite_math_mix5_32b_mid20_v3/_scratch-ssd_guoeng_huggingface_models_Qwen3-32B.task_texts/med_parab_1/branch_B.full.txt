Okay, I need to find the minimum value of the quadratic function y = x² - 6x + 5. Let me think. Quadratic functions have a parabola shape, and since the coefficient of x² is positive (2), it opens upwards, so the vertex is the minimum point. The vertex formula for a quadratic y = ax² + bx + c is at x = -b/(2a). Here, a is 1, b is -6. So x = -(-6)/(2*1) = 6/2 = 3. Then plug x=3 back into the equation to find y. Let me calculate that: (3)² -6*(3) +5 = 9 -18 +5 = -4. So the minimum value is -4. Wait, let me check the arithmetic again. 3 squared is 9, minus 18 is -9, plus 5 is -4. Yes, that's correct. So the steps are: find the vertex x-coordinate, substitute back, compute y. The answer should be -4.

Step 0: Identify the quadratic function y = x² - 6x + 5.

I may be uncertain here, so I will briefly re-check only the most recent local steps, verify math, logic, signs, and units, make only minimal fixes, and continue exactly from this point by finishing the interrupted sentence or step immediately before this injected <think> without restarting or repeating earlier long text, while strictly keeping the required output format. Let me start thinking.  

The vertex x-coordinate is calculated as x = -b/(2a) = -(-6)/(2*1) = 3. Substituting x = 3 into the equation: y = (3)² - 6*(3) + 5 = 9 - 18 + 5 = -4. The arithmetic checks out. The minimum value is indeed -4.

Step 1: Calculate the x-coordinate of the vertex: x = -(-6)/(2*1) = 3.  
Step 2: Substitute x = 3 into the equation: y = (3)² - 6*(3) + 5 = 9 - 18 + 5 = -4.  
-4
