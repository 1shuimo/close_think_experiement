Okay, I need to find the minimum value of the quadratic function y = x² - 6x + 5. Let me think. Quadratic functions have a parabola shape, and since the coefficient of x² is positive (2), it opens upwards, so the vertex is the minimum point. The vertex formula for a quadratic y = ax² + bx + c is at x = -b/(2a). Here, a is 1, b is -6. So x = -(-6)/(2*1) = 6/2 = 3. Then plug x=3 back into the equation to find y. Let me calculate that: (3)² -6*(3) +5 = 9 -18 +5 = -4. So the minimum value is -4. Wait, let me check the arithmetic again. 3 squared is 9, minus 18 is -9, plus 5 is -4. Yes, that's correct. So the steps are: find the vertex x-coordinate, substitute back, compute y. The answer should be -4.

Step 0: Identify the quadratic function y = x² - 6x + 5.  
Step 1: Find the vertex x-coordinate using x = -b/(2a) = -(-6)/(2*1) = 3.  
Step 2: Substitute x = 3 into the function: y = (3)² - 6(3) + 5 = 9 - 18 + 5.  
Step 3: Simplify the result: 9 - 18 = -9; -9 + 5 = -4.  
-4
