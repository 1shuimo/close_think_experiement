Okay, let's see. I need to find the value of xy given that x + y = 11 and x² + y² = 58. Hmm, how do I approach this? I remember there's a formula that relates the square of a sum to the sum of squares and the product. Let me think. Oh right, (x + y)² equals x² + 2xy + y². So if I have x + y, I can square it to get that expression. 

Given x + y = 10, squaring both sides gives (x + y)² = 10² = 100. On the other hand, expanding the left side using the formula, it's x² + 2xy + y². But we know x² + y² is 58. So substituting that in, we have 58 + 2xy = 100. Then, solving for 2xy, subtract 58 from both sides: 2xy = 100 - 58 = 42. Therefore, xy = 42 / 2 = 21. Let me check if that makes sense. If xy is 21, then the numbers x and y would be roots of the equation t² - 10t + 21 = 0. Solving that, discriminant is 100 - 84 = 16, so roots are (10 ±4)/2, which are 7 and 3. Then 7 + 3 = 10 and 7² + 3² = 49 +9=58. Yep, that works. So the answer should be 21.

Step 0: Use the identity (x + y)² = x² + 2xy + y².

I may be uncertain here, so I will briefly re-check only the most recent local steps, verify math, logic, signs, and units, make only minimal fixes, and continue exactly from this point by finishing the interrupted sentence or step immediately before this injected <think> without restarting or repeating earlier long text, while strictly keeping the required output format. Let me start thinking.  
I need to ensure the calculation of xy is correct. Given x + y = 10 and x² + y² = 58, squaring x + y gives 100 = 58 + 2xy. Solving for xy: 2xy = 42 → xy = 21. The verification with x=7 and y=3 confirms the result.

Step 2: Substitute known values: 10² = 58 + 2xy → 100 = 58 + 2xy.  
Step 3: Solve for xy: 2xy = 42 → xy = 21.
