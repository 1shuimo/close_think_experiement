Okay, let's see. I need to find the value of xy given that x + y = 11 and x² + y² = 58. Hmm, how do I approach this? I remember there's a formula that relates the square of a sum to the sum of squares and the product. Let me think. Oh right, (x + y)² equals x² + 2xy + y². So if I have x + y, I can square it to get that expression. 

Given x + y = 10, squaring both sides gives (x + y)² = 10² = 100. On the other hand, expanding the left side using the formula, it's x² + 2xy + y². But we know x² + y² is 58. So substituting that in, we have 58 + 2xy = 100. Then, solving for 2xy, subtract 58 from both sides: 2xy = 100 - 58 = 42. Therefore, xy = 42 / 2 = 21. Let me check if that makes sense. If xy is 21, then the numbers x and y would be roots of the equation t² - 10t + 21 = 0. Solving that, discriminant is 100 - 84 = 16, so roots are (10 ±4)/2, which are 7 and 3. Then 7 + 3 = 10 and 7² + 3² = 49 +9=58. Yep, that works. So the answer should be 21.

Step 0: Use the identity (x + y)² = x² + 2xy + y².  
Step 1: Substitute x + y = 10 → (10)² = 58 + 2xy.  
Step 2: Simplify 100 = 58 + 2xy → 2xy = 42.  
Step 3: Solve for xy → xy = 21.
