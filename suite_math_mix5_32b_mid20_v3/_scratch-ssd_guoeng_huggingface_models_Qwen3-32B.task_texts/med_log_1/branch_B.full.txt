Okay, let's see. I need to solve the equation log base 2 of x plus log base 2 of (x minus 2) equals 3. Hmm, right. So first, I remember that when you add two logarithms with the same base, you can multiply their arguments. So log2(x) - log2(x-2) is the same as log2(x*(x-2)). That should simplify the equation to log2(x(x-2)) = 3. 

Then, to get rid of the logarithm, I can rewrite the equation in exponential form. Since log base 2 of something equals 3 means that 2^3 equals that something. So 2^3 is 8. Therefore, x(x-2) should equal 8. 

Expanding that, x squared minus 2x equals 8. Then, subtract 8 from both sides to set the equation to zero: x² - 2x - 8 = 0. Now, I need to solve this quadratic equation. Let's factor it. Looking for two numbers that multiply to -8 and add to -2. Hmm, factors of -8 could be -4 and 2. Yes, because -4 * 2 = -8 and -4 + 2 = -2. So the factors are (x - 4)(x + 2) = 0. 

Setting each factor equal to zero gives x = 4 or x = -2. But wait, I need to check if these solutions are valid in the original logarithmic equation. Logarithms are only defined for positive arguments. So for log2(x) and log2(x-2), x must be greater than 2. Because x has to be positive, and x-2 also has to be positive. So x > 2. 

Checking x = 4: 4 is greater than 2, so that's valid. Checking x = -2: -2 is not greater than 2, so that's invalid. Therefore, the only solution is x = 4. 

Wait, but let me double-check. If I plug x = 4 into the original equation: log2(4) is 2, and log2(4-2) is log2(2) which is 1. Adding them gives 2 + 1 = 3, which matches the right side. So that works. For x = -2, log2(-2) is undefined, so that's definitely out. So yeah, the answer is 4.

I may be uncertain here, so I will briefly re-check only the most recent local steps, verify math, logic, signs, and units, make only minimal fixes, and continue exactly from this point by finishing the interrupted sentence or step immediately before this injected <think> without restarting or repeating earlier long text, while strictly keeping the required output format. Let me start thinking. I need to output the final answer as per the instructions. Let me ensure I follow the format.  

Step 0: Combine logarithms using log₂(a) + log₂(b) = log₂(ab): log₂(x(x - 2)) = 3.  
Step 1: Convert to exponential form: x(x - 2) = 2³ = 8.  
Step 2: Expand and solve quadratic: x² - 2x - 8 = 0.  
Step 3: Factor: (x - 4)(x + 2) = 0 ⇒ x = 4 or x = -2.  
Step 4: Check domain: x > 2 ⇒ x = 4 is valid.  
Step 5: Verify solution: log₂(4) + log₂(2) = 2 + 1 = 3.
