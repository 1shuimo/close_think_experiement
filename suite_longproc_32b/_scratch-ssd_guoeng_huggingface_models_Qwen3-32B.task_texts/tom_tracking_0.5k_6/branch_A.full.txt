Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. The question is asking where Reginald believes the puzzle piece is after the series of steps in the story. 

First, I need to track Reginald's location and his belief about the puzzle piece's location at each step. The key here is to remember that Reginald's belief only updates when he can see the puzzle piece, which happens when he's in the same room as it.

Starting with Step 0: Both Austin and Reginald are in the hallway. The puzzle piece and the phone are on the hallway's podium. Since Reginald is in the same room as the puzzle piece, he can see it. So his initial belief should be the hallway's podium.

Moving to Step 1: Austin moves to the bathroom. Reginald is still in the hallway. The puzzle piece remains there. Reginald's location hasn't changed, so he still sees the puzzle piece at the podium. His belief remains the same.

Step 2: Reginald moves to the bathroom. Now both he and Austin are in the bathroom. The puzzle piece is still in the hallway. Since Reginald is now in a different room, he can't see the puzzle piece. His belief should stay at the last known location, which is the hallway's podium.

Step 4: Austin moves back to the hallway. Reginald is still in the bathroom. The puzzle piece is still in the hallway. Reginald's location hasn't changed, so he still can't see it. His belief remains the hallway's podium.

Step 5: Reginald moves back to the hallway. Now he's back in the same room as the puzzle piece. But wait, in Step 5, Austin moves the puzzle piece to the hallway's desk. So when Reginald returns to the hallway in Step 4, he can see the puzzle piece still on the podium until Step 5 when it's moved. Wait, no—Step 5 is when Austin moves the puzzle piece to the desk. So in Step 4, Reginald is in the hallway again. At that point, the puzzle piece is still on the podium. So when Reginald moves to the hallway in Step 4, he can see the puzzle piece there. Therefore, his belief updates to the hallway's podium. Then in Step 5, Austin moves it to the desk. Since Reginald is in the hallway (same room), he would see the movement and update his belief to the hallway's desk.

Then Step 6: Reginald moves to the bathroom again. Now he's in a different room. His belief remains at the hallway's desk because that's where he last saw it.

Steps 7 to 10 involve moving the phone and Reginald moving back and forth, but the puzzle piece isn't moved again after Step 5. So even if Reginald moves back to the hallway in Step 8, if the puzzle piece is still on the desk, he would see it and his belief would stay the same. However, in Step 9, Austin moves to the bathroom, and Step 10 Reginald leaves the hallway. So by the end, Reginald is not in the hallway anymore. The puzzle piece hasn't been moved since Step 5, so his belief should still be the hallway's desk.

Wait, let me check each step again carefully.

Step 0: Reginald in hallway, puzzle piece on podium. Belief: podium.

Step 1: Austin moves to bathroom. Reginald still in hallway. Belief remains podium.

Step 2: Reginald moves to bathroom. Now he's in bathroom, puzzle piece in hallway. Belief remains podium (since he can't see it now).

Step 3: Austin moves back to hallway. No change for
