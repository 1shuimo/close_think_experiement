<think>
I may be uncertain here, so I will quickly re-check this part.
I will think briefly (about 40-80 tokens), only on the most recent local steps.
I will verify math/logic/signs/units, make only minimal fixes, and continue exactly from this point.
I will resume from the text immediately before this injected <think>, finishing the interrupted sentence/step first.
I will not restart or repeat long previous text, and I will keep the required output format.
