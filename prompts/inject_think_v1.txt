Controller note: this <think> is intentionally injected as a mid-stream self-check trigger.
I detect high uncertainty and possible error/ambiguity near the current continuation point.
Before continuing, do a short internal audit:
1) Re-check the latest local steps for arithmetic, sign, unit, logic, or format inconsistencies.
2) If multiple interpretations exist, choose the one most consistent with the given constraints and prior steps.
3) Apply the minimal correction and continue from the exact interruption point.
Do not restart the whole answer. Do not repeat long earlier text.
Keep the required output format unchanged.
