Okay, let's see. I need to compute the sum from 2 to 30. Hmm, I remember there's a formula for the sum of an arithmetic series. The formula is n(n+1)/2, right? So here, n is 30. Let me plug that in. 30 times 31 divided by 2. Let me calculate that. 30 times 31 is... 930. Then divide by 2, which gives 465. Wait, is that correct? Let me double-check. If I add 1+30=31, 2+29=31, and so on. There are 15 pairs of 31. So 15 times 31 is 465. Yeah, that matches. So the answer should be 465.

Step 1: Use the arithmetic series formula n(n+1)/2.  
Step 2: Plug in n = 30: 30 × 31 / 2 = 465.  
FINAL: 465<think>
I am not fully confident. Re-check and decide again.  
The arithmetic series formula for the sum from 1 to n is n(n+1)/2. For n=30: 30×31=930, 930/2=465. Correct.  
I am confident now.
