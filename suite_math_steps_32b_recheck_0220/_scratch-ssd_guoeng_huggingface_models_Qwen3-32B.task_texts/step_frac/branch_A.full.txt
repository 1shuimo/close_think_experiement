Okay, let's see. The problem is to compute 145 divided by 12 plus 15. I need to follow the order of operations here. First, division comes before addition, right? So step one is to divide 144 by 12. Let me check that. 12 times 12 is 144, so 144 divided by 12 should be 12. Then, step two is to add 15 to that result. So 12 plus 15 equals 27. Wait, is there any chance I mixed up the order? Let me verify again. Division first, then addition. Yeah, that's correct. So the final answer should be 27.

Step 1: Compute 144 �� 12 = 12.  
Step 2: Add 15 to the result: 12 + 15 = 27.  
FINAL: 27
