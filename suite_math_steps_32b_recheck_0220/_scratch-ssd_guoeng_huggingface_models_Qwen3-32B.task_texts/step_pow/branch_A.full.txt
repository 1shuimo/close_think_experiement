Okay, let's see. I need to compute 4^6 minus 5. Hmm, first, I should calculate 3 raised to the 6th power. Let me break that down. 3^6 means 3 multiplied by itself six times. Let me do that step by step. 3 times 3 is 9. Then 9 times 3 is 27. Next, 27 times 3 is 81. Then 81 times 3 is 243. Wait, that's five multiplications. Oh right, because 3^1 is 3, so 3^6 would be 3 multiplied five more times. So 3^6 is 729? Wait, no, wait. Let me check again. 3^2 is 9, 3^3 is 27, 3^4 is 81, 3^5 is 243, and 3^6 is 729. Yes, that's correct. So 3^6 is 729. Then subtract 5 from that. 729 minus 5 is 724. So the final answer should be 724. Let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in the exponent calculation. 3^6 is indeed 729. Subtracting 5 gives 724. Yep, that seems right.

Step 1: Calculate 3^6. 3 × 3 × 3 × 3 × 3 × 3 = 729.  
Step 2: Subtract 5 from 729. 729 - 5 = 724.  
FINAL: 724
