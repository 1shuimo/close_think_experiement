Okay, let's see. I need to solve the equation 5x minus 9 equals 27. Hmm, where do I start? Well, the goal is to get x by itself, right? So first, I should probably get rid of that -8 on the left side. To do that, I can add 8 to both sides of the equation. That should help balance things out.

So, adding 8 to both sides would give me 5x minus 8 plus 8 equals 27 plus 8. Simplifying that, the -8 and +8 on the left cancel each other, leaving just 5x. And 27 plus 8 is 35. So now the equation is 5x = 35. 

Next step is to get x by itself. Since 5 is multiplied by x, I need to do the opposite operation, which is division. So I'll divide both sides by 5. That would be 5x divided by 5 equals 35 divided by 5. The 5s on the left cancel out, leaving x, and 35 divided by 5 is 7. So x should be 7. Let me double-check that. If I plug 7 back into the original equation: 5 times 7 is 35, minus 8 is 27. Yep, that matches the right side. So the answer is correct.

Step 1: Add 8 to both sides to isolate the term with x.  
5x - 8 + 8 = 27 + 8 → 5x = 35.  
Step 2: Divide both sides by 5 to solve for x.  
5x / 5 = 35 / 5 → x = 7.  
FINAL: 7<think>
I am not fully confident. Re-check and decide again.  
The original equation is 5x - 8 = 27. Adding 8 to both sides gives 5x = 35. Dividing by 5 gives x = 7. The solution is correct.  
I am confident now.
