Okay, let's see. I need to solve the equation 2x + 6 = 19. Hmm, where do I start? Well, the goal is to get x by itself, right? So first, I should probably subtract 5 from both sides to get rid of that constant term. Let me check: 2x + 5 minus 5 would be 2x, and 19 minus 5 is 14. So then the equation becomes 2x = 14. 

Wait, is that right? Let me make sure. If I subtract 5 from both sides, yes, that's correct. Then the next step would be to divide both sides by 2 to solve for x. So 2x divided by 2 is x, and 14 divided by 2 is 7. So x should be 7. 

But wait, maybe I should verify. Let me plug it back into the original equation. 2 times 7 is 14, plus 5 is 19. Yep, that matches the right side. So the solution is correct. I think that's all the steps. Let me write them out properly.

Step 1: Subtract 5 from both sides: 2x = 19 - 5 → 2x = 14.  
Step 2: Divide both sides by 2: x = 14 / 2 → x = 7.

I am not fully confident. Re-check and decide again.  
Step 1: Subtract 5 from both sides: 2x = 14.  
Step 2: Divide both sides by 2: x = 7.  
Verification: 2(7) + 5 = 14 + 5 = 19.  
I am confident in the solution.

Step 1: Subtract 5 from both sides: 2x = 14.  
Step 2: Divide both sides by 2: x = 7.  
FINAL: 7
