Okay, let's see. I need to compute 49 multiplied by 17. Hmm, how do I approach this? Maybe break it down into smaller parts. Let me try using the distributive property. So, 48 times 17 can be thought of as 48 times (10 + 7). That would be 48*10 plus 48*7. 

Wait, 48*10 is straightforward, that's 480. Then 48*7. Let me calculate that. 40*7 is 280, and 8*7 is 56. Adding those together, 280 + 56 equals 336. So then, adding the two parts: 480 + 336. Let me add those numbers. 480 + 300 is 780, and then +36 makes 816. 

Wait, is that right? Let me check again. 48*17. Another way could be to do 50*17 minus 2*17. Because 50 is easier to handle. 50*17 is 850. Then 2*17 is 34. Subtracting 34 from 850 gives 816. Yeah, that matches. So both methods give the same result. I think that's correct. So the final answer should be 816.

Step 1: Break down 17 into 10 + 7. Compute 48*10 = 480 and 48*7 = 336.  
Step 2: Add the results: 480 + 336 = 816.  
FINAL: 816
