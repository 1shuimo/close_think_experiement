  "user_prompt": "[TASK]\nYou'll see a story about object placement. Each story involves four components: Agents, Objects, Rooms, and Containers. Given a question about an (agent, object) pair, your task is to track the locations and beliefs in stories about object placement asked in the question.\n\n[APPROACH]\nYou will solve the problem by tracking the location of the agent, location of the object, and the agent's belief of the object.\n1. Initial Setup: set up agent's starting location, object's starting location, agent's initial belief on the object's location. Note that if an agent does not see an object at the start, their belief on the object is None.\n2. Then, track step-by-step:\n* If a step involves that the agent moves to another room, leaves a room, or enters a room, you should update the agent's location. Note that if the agent leaves the current room but hasn't entered another room, the agent's location is None.\n* If a step involves the object of interest moving, you should update the object's location.\n* To keep track of the agent's belief on the object: If the agent and the object are in the same room, the agent can see the object, so the agent's belief will reflect the true location of the object. If the agent cannot see the object (the agent is in a different room or not in any rooms), the agent's belief will remain unchanged until the agent sees the object again.\n3. Format your output exactly as shown in example answers below.\n\n[EXAMPLE STORY1]\nStep 0: Catherine is in the patio; Kristin is in the patio; the pencil sharpener is on the sauna's table; the thread spool is on the sauna's table.\nStep 1: Catherine moves to the sauna.\nStep 2: Catherine moves to the patio.\nStep 3: Catherine moves to the sauna.\nStep 4: Catherine moves the pencil sharpener to the sauna's nightstand.\nStep 5: Catherine moves to the patio.\nStep 6: Kristin moves to the sauna.\nStep 7: Catherine moves to the sauna.\nStep 8: Kristin leaves the room he was in.\nStep 9: Catherine moves the thread spool to the sauna's nightstand.\nStep 10: Kristin enters the patio.\n\n[EXAMPLE QUESTION1]\nWhere does Catherine believe the thread spool is?\n\n[EXAMPLE ANSWER1]\nCatherine's belief on the thread spool:\n- Step 0: (initial state) {Catherine location: patio; thread spool location: sauna's table; Catherine sees thread spool: False; Catherine's belief on thread spool: None}\n- Step 1: (Catherine location changed; thread spool location unchanged) {Catherine location: sauna;

thread spool location: sauna's nightstand; Catherine sees thread spool: True; Catherine's belief on thread spool: sauna's nightstand}\n- Step 10: (Catherine location unchanged; thread spool location unchanged) {Catherine location: sauna; thread spool location: sauna's nightstand; Catherine sees thread spool: True; Catherine's belief on thread spool: sauna's nightstand}\nFinal Answer: the sauna's nightstand\n\n\n[EXAMPLE STORY2]\nStep 0: Kathryn is in the storage room;
