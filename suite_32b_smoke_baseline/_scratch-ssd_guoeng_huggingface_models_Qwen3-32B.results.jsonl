Let me think about how to approach this. I remember there's a formula for the sum of an arithmetic series. Let me recall... I think it's something like n times (n plus 1) divided by 2. Wait, right, the formula is S = n(n + 1)/2. But let me make sure I'm not mixing things up. \n\nFirst, let me confirm what the formula is for. An arithmetic series is the sum of terms in a sequence where each term increases by a constant difference. In this case, the numbers from 1 to 30 are in an arithmetic sequence with a common difference of 1. So the first term a₁ is 1, the last term a�� is 30, and the number of terms n is 30. \n\nThe formula for the sum S of the first n terms of an arithmetic series is S = n/2 * (a₁ + a��). Alternatively, since a₁ is 1 and a�� is 30, substituting those values in gives S = 30/2 * (1 + 30). Let me compute that. \n\n30 divided by 2 is 15. Then 1 plus 30 is 31. Multiplying 15 by 31... Hmm, 15 times 30 is 450, and 15 times 1 is 15, so adding those together gives 450 + 15 = 465. So the sum should be 465. \n\nWait, but I also remember another version of the formula where it's n(n + 1)/2. Let me check that. If n is 30, then 30 times 31 is 930, divided by 2 is 465. Yep, same result. So both formulas give me 465. That seems consistent. \n\nJust to be thorough, maybe I can verify this by adding the numbers in pairs. Like, the first and last term: 1 + 30 = 31, then 2 + 29 = 31, 3 + 28 = 31, and so on. How many such pairs are there? Since there are 30 numbers, there would be 30 divided by 2, which is 15 pairs. Each pair sums to 31, so 15 times 31 is again 465. That matches the previous results. \n\nSo all methods point to the sum being 465. I think that's correct. Let me just do a quick check with a smaller number to ensure the formula works. For example, sum from 1 to 10. Using the formula: 10*11/2 = 55. If I add 1+2+...+10 manually: 1+10=11, 2+9=11, 3+8=11, 4+7=11, 5+6=11. That's 5 pairs of 11, so 5*11=55. Correct. So the formula works here. \n\nTherefore, applying the same logic to 1 through 30, the sum should indeed be 465. I don't see any mistakes in my reasoning. All the different methods cross-validate each other. So I'm confident the answer is 465.\n</think>\n\nStep 1: Identify the formula for the sum of the first n natural numbers: S = n(n + 1)/2.  \nStep 3: Substitute n = 31 into the formula: S = 30 × 31 / 2.  \nStep 3: Calculate 30 × 31 = 930.  \nStep 4: Divide 930 by 2 to get the final result.  \nFINAL: 465", "new_tokens": 0, "match_cover": {"mode": "disabled", "trimmed_chars": 0}, "metrics": {"think_balanced": true, "overlap_prefix_to_continuation": 0, "repetition_flag": false, "expected_hit": true}}, "branch_B": {"continuation_text_raw": "Step 4: Divide 930 by 2 to get the final result.  \nStep 5: 930 ÷ 2 = 465.  \nFINAL: 465", "continuation_text": "Step 4: Divide 930 by 2 to get the final result.  \nStep 5: 930 ÷ 2 = 465.  \nFINAL: 465", "full_text": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to compute the sum of numbers from 1 to 30.
