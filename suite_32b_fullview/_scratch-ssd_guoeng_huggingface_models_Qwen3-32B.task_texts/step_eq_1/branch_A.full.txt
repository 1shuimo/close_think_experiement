Okay, let's see. I need to solve the equation 2x + 6 = 19. Hmm, right. The goal is to find the value of x that makes this equation true. So, first, I should probably get rid of that 5 that's being added to the 2x. To do that, I can subtract 5 from both sides of the equation. That should keep things balanced.

So, subtracting 5 from both sides would give me 2x = 19 - 5. Let me calculate 19 minus 5. That's 14. So now the equation is 2x = 14. 

Now, I need to solve for x. Since 2 is multiplied by x, I should divide both sides by 2 to isolate x. Dividing both sides by 2 gives x = 14 / 2. And 14 divided by 2 is 7. So x should be 7. Let me check that. If I plug 7 back into the original equation: 2*7 is 14, plus 5 is 19. Yep, that matches the right side. So that's correct.

Step 1: Subtract 5 from both sides: 2x = 19 - 5 → 2x = 14.  
Step 2: Divide both sides by 2: x = 14 / 2 → x = 7.  
FINAL: 7
