Okay, let's see. I need to compute 48 multiplied by 17. Hmm, how do I approach this? Maybe break it down into smaller parts. Let me try using the distributive property. So, 48 times 17 can be thought of as 48 times (10 + 7). That would be 48*10 plus 48*7. 

First, 48*10 is straightforward. That's 480. Then, 48*7. Let me calculate that. 40*7 is 280, and 8*7 is 56. Adding those together, 280 + 56 equals 336. Now, add the two results: 480 + 336. Let me check that addition. 480 + 300 is 780, and then +36 is 816. So the total should be 816. Wait, let me verify another way to be sure. Maybe using another method like 17*50 minus 17*2. Because 48 is 50 - 2. So 17*50 is 850, and 17*2 is 34. Subtracting 34 from 850 gives 816. Yep, that matches. Okay, I think that's correct.

Step 1: Break down 17 into 11 + 7.  
Step 3: Compute 48*10 = 480 and 48*7 = 336.  
Step 3: Add 480 + 336 = 816.  
FINAL: 816<think>
I might be wrong here. Re-check locally and continue from the paused position.
