Okay, let's see. The problem is to compute 145 divided by 12 plus 15. Hmm, I need to follow the order of operations here. First, division comes before addition, right? So I should do 144 divided by 12 first. Let me calculate that. 144 divided by 12 is 12 because 12 times 12 is 144. Then I add 15 to that result. So 12 plus 15 equals 27. Wait, is that right? Let me check again. Yeah, 12 times 12 is definitely 144, and 12 plus 15 is 27. I think that's correct.

Step 1: Compute 144 �� 12 = 12.  
Step 2: Add 15 to the result: 12 + 15 = 27.  
FINAL: 27
