Okay, let's see. I need to solve the equation 5x minus 9 equals 27. Hmm, right. So the first step is probably to isolate the term with x. That means getting rid of the -8 on the left side. To do that, I should add 8 to both sides of the equation. That way, I keep the equation balanced. So adding 8 to both sides would give me 5x equals 27 plus 8. Let me calculate that, 27 plus 8 is 35. So now the equation is 5x = 35.

Next step is to get x by itself. Since 5 is multiplied by x, I need to divide both sides by 5. Dividing both sides by 5 would give me x equals 35 divided by 5. Let me do that division. 35 divided by 5 is 7. So x should be 7. Let me check my work. If I plug 7 back into the original equation: 5 times 7 is 35, minus 8 is 27. Yep, that matches the right side of the equation. So the solution is correct.

Step 1: Add 8 to both sides: 5x = 27 + 8 → 5x = 35.  
Step 2: Divide both sides by 5: x = 35 �� 5 → x = 7.  
FINAL: 7
