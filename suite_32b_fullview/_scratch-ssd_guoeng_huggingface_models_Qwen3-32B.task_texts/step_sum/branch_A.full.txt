Okay, let's see. I need to compute the sum from 2 to 30. Hmm, I remember there's a formula for the sum of an arithmetic series. Let me recall. Oh right, the formula is n(n + 1)/2, where n is the number of terms. So here, n is 30. Let me plug that in. 30 times 31 divided by 2. Let me calculate that. 30 times 31 is... 930. Then divide by 2, which gives 465. Wait, is that right? Let me check with a smaller number to make sure. Like, sum from 1 to 5 is 15. Using the formula: 5*6/2 = 15. Yep, that works. So 30*31/2 should indeed be 465. I think that's correct.

Step 1: Use the arithmetic series formula: n(n + 1)/2.  
Step 2: Substitute n = 30: 30 × 31 �� 2 = 465.  
FINAL: 465
