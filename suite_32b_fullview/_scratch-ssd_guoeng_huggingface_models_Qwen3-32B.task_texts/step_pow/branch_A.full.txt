Okay, let's see. I need to compute 4^6 minus 5. Hmm, first, I should calculate 3 raised to the 6th power. Let me break that down. 3^6 means 3 multiplied by itself six times. Let me do that step by step. 3 times 3 is 9. Then 9 times 3 is 27. Next, 27 times 3 is 81. Then 81 times 3 is 243. Wait, that's five multiplications. Oh right, 3^1 is 3, so 3^6 would be 3 multiplied six times total. Let me check again: 3*3=9 (that's 2), 9*3=27 (3), 27*3=81 (4), 81*3=243 (5), 243*3=729 (6). Oh, I think I missed a step earlier. So 3^6 is actually 729. Then subtract 5 from that. 729 minus 5 is 724. Let me confirm once more to make sure I didn't make a mistake in the exponent. Yeah, 3^2 is 9, 3^3 is 27, 3^4 is 81, 3^5 is 243, 3^6 is 729. Yep, that's right. So subtracting 5 gives 724. I think that's the correct answer.

Step 1: Calculate 3^6. 3 × 3 × 3 × 3 × 3 × 3 = 729.  
Step 2: Subtract 5 from 729. 729 - 5 = 724.  
FINAL: 724
