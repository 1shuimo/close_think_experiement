Okay, let's see. I need to find the minimum value of the quadratic function y = x² - 6x + 5. Hmm, quadratics have either a minimum or maximum point depending on the coefficient of x². Since the coefficient here is positive (2), it opens upwards, so the vertex will be the minimum point. Right, so the vertex form of a quadratic is y = a(x - h)² + k, where (h, k) is the vertex. To find the vertex, I can use the formula h = -b/(2a) for the x-coordinate. In this equation, a is 1 and b is -6. Plugging those in, h = -(-6)/(2*1) = 6/2 = 3. Then, substitute x = 3 back into the original equation to find k, which is the minimum value. Let's calculate that: y = (3)² - 6*(3) + 5 = 9 - 18 + 5. That adds up to 9 - 18 is -9, plus 5 is -4. So the minimum value should be -4. Wait, let me double-check the substitution. 3 squared is 9, 6 times 3 is 18, so 9 minus 18 is -9, plus 5 is indeed -4. Yeah, that seems right. Alternatively, I could complete the square. Let's try that method to confirm. Starting with y = x² -6x +5. Take the coefficient of x, which is -6, divide by 2 to get -3, square it to get 9. So add and subtract 9: y = (x² -6x +9) -9 +5. That becomes (x-3)² -4. So the vertex is at (3, -4), confirming the minimum value is -4. Both methods give the same result, so I'm confident the answer is -4.
