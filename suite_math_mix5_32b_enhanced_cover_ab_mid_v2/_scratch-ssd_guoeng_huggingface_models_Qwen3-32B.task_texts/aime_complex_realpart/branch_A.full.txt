Okay, let's try to solve this problem step by step. The question is asking for the largest possible real part of the expression [(75 - 117i)z + (96 + 144i)/z] where z is a complex number with |z| = 4. Hmm, so z is a complex number on the circle with radius 4 centered at the origin. 

First, I remember that when dealing with complex numbers and their magnitudes, sometimes it's helpful to express them in polar form. Since |z| = 4, we can write z as 4e^{iθ}, where �� is the argument of z. That might make things easier because then 1/z would be 1/(4e^{iθ}) = (1/4)e^{-iθ}. 

So substituting z = 4e^{iθ} into the expression, let's see:

The first term is (75 + 117i)z. If z is 4e^{iθ}, then multiplying by (75 + 117i) would give 4*(75 + 117i)e^{iθ}. The second term is (96 + 144i)/z, which would be (96 + 144i)/4 * e^{-iθ} = 24*(4 + 3i) * e^{-iθ} because 96/24 is 4 and 144/24 is 6? Wait, 96 divided by 4 is 24? Wait, 96 divided by 4 is 24? Wait, 4 times 24 is 96, yes. And 144 divided by 4 is 36. Wait, no, 144 divided by 4 is 36. Wait, but 96 + 144i divided by 4 is 24 + 36i. Oh, I think I made a mistake there. Let me recalculate that. 

Original term: (96 + 144i)/z. Since z is 4e^{iθ}, then 1/z is (1/4)e^{-iθ}. So multiplying (96 + 144i) by 1/z gives (96 + 144i)*(1/4)*e^{-iθ} = (24 + 36i)e^{-iθ}. Right, because 96/4 is 24 and 144/4 is 36. So that term is 24 + 36i multiplied by e^{-iθ}.

So the entire expression becomes:

(75 + 117i)*4e^{iθ} + (24 + 36i)e^{-iθ}

Let me compute the coefficients:

First term coefficient: 4*(75 + 117i) = 300 + 468i

Second term coefficient: 24 + 36i

So the expression is (300 + 468i)e^{iθ} + (24 + 36i)e^{-iθ}

Now, we need to find the real part of this expression. Let's denote the entire expression as E. So Re(E) is the real part we need to maximize.

To find Re(E), we can write each term in terms of cosine and sine. Let me recall that e^{iθ} = cosθ + i sinθ and e^{-iθ} = cosθ - i sinθ.

So expanding the first term: (300 + 468i)(cosθ + i sinθ)

Multiplying this out:

300*cosθ + 300i sinθ + 468i cosθ + 468i^2 sinθ

Since i^2 = -1, this becomes:

300 cosθ + 300i sinθ + 468i cosθ - 468 sinθ

Similarly, the second term: (24 + 36i)(cosθ - i sinθ)

Expanding:

24 cosθ - 24i sinθ + 36i cosθ - 36i^2 sinθ

Again, i^2 = -1, so:

24 cosθ -24i sinθ + 36i cosθ + 36 sinθ

Now, combining both terms:

First term's real parts: 300 cosθ - 468 sinθ

First term's imaginary parts: 300i sinθ + 468i cosθ

Second term's real parts: 24 cosθ + 36 sinθ

Second term's imaginary parts: -24i sinθ + 36i cosθ

Adding all the real parts together:

(300 cosθ - 468 sinθ) + (24 cosθ + 36 sinθ) = (300 + 24) cosθ + (-468 + 36) sinθ = 324 cosθ - 432 sinθ

Similarly, the imaginary parts would be:

(300i sinθ + 468i cosθ) + (-24i sinθ + 36i cosθ) = [300 sinθ -24 sinθ]i + [468 cosθ + 36 cosθ]i = 276i sinθ + 504i cosθ

But since we are only interested in the real part of the entire expression, we can ignore the imaginary parts. So Re(E) = 324 cosθ - 432 sinθ.

Wait, that seems manageable. So the problem reduces to finding the maximum value of 324 cosθ - 432 sinθ. 

This is a standard problem of finding the maximum of a linear combination of sine and cosine. The maximum value of A cosθ + B sinθ is sqrt(A² + B²). Wait, but here it's A cosθ - B sinθ. Let me check. The general formula is that the maximum of C cosθ + D sinθ is sqrt(C² + D²). So in this case, our expression is 324 cosθ - 432 sinθ, which can be written as 324 cosθ + (-432) sinθ. Therefore, the maximum value is sqrt(324² + (-432)^2).

Let me compute that. First, compute 324 squared and 432 squared.

324^2: Let's see, 300^2 = 90000, 24^2 = 576, and cross term 2*300*24 = 14400. So (300 + 24)^2 = 300^2 + 2*300*24 + 24^2 = 90000 + 14400 + 576 = 104,976.

Similarly, 432^2: Let's compute 400^2 + 2*400*32 + 32^2. Wait, 432 is 400 + 32. So (400 + 32)^2 = 400^2 + 2*400*32 + 32^2 = 160000 + 25600 + 1024 = 160000 + 25600 is 185600, plus 1024 is 186,624.

So sqrt(104,976 + 186,624) = sqrt(291,600). What's sqrt(291600)? Let's see, 500^2 is 250,000, 540^2 is 291,600. Yes, because 540*540 = (500 + 40)^2 = 500^2 + 2*500*40 + 40^2 = 250,000 + 40,000 + 1,600 = 291,600. So sqrt(291,600) = 540. Therefore, the maximum value of Re(E) is 540. 

Wait, but let me confirm that I didn't make a mistake in the coefficients. Let me retrace the steps. 

Original expression after substitution and expansion: Re(E) = 324 cosθ - 432 sinθ. Then maximum is sqrt(324² + 432²). Wait, but 324 and 432 have a common factor. Let me check if I can factor that out to simplify. 

324 and 432: Let's see, GCD of 324 and 432. 324 divides by 81? 81*4=324. 432 divided by 81 is 5.333... Hmm, maybe 108? 324 divided by 108 is 3, 432 divided by 108 is 4. So 324 = 108*3, 432=108*4. Therefore, sqrt( (108*3)^2 + (108*4)^2 ) = 108*sqrt(9 + 16) = 108*sqrt(25) = 108*5 = 540. Yep, same result. So that's correct. 

Therefore, the maximum real part is 540. 

But wait, let me check if I did all the steps correctly. Let me go back through the expansion again. 

Original expression after substitution: (300 + 468i)e^{iθ} + (24 + 36i)e^{-iθ}

Expanding the first term:

(300 + 468i)(cosθ + i sinθ) = 300 cosθ + 300i sinθ + 468i cosθ + 468i^2 sinθ = 300 cosθ - 468 sinθ + i(300 sinθ + 468 cosθ)

Second term: (24 + 36i)(cosθ - i sinθ) = 24 cosθ -24i sinθ + 36i cosθ -36i^2 sinθ = 24 cosθ + 36 sinθ + i(-24 sinθ + 36 cosθ)

Adding the real parts: (300 cosθ - 468 sinθ) + (24 cosθ + 36 sinθ) = 324 cosθ - 432 sinθ. Correct. 

Imaginary parts: (300 sinθ + 468 cosθ) + (-24 sinθ + 36 cosθ) = (300 -24) sinθ + (468 + 36) cosθ = 276 sinθ + 504 cosθ. But since we only care about the real part, that's fine. 

So yes, the real part is indeed 324 cosθ - 432 sinθ, and its maximum is 540. 

Therefore, the answer should be 540. But let me check if there's any step where I might have miscalculated. 

Wait, another way to approach this problem is by using the fact that for complex numbers, if |z| = 4, then 1/z = conjugate(z)/|z|². Since |z|² is 16, so 1/z = conjugate(z)/16. Therefore, the expression becomes (75 + 117i)z + (96 + 144i) * conjugate(z)/16. 

Let me compute (96 + 144i)/16. 96/16 is 6, 144/16 is 9. So that term is 6 + 9i. Therefore, the entire expression is (75 + 117i)z + (6 + 9i) conjugate(z). 

Now, let me denote z = x + iy, where x and y are real numbers such that x² + y² = 16. Then conjugate(z) = x - iy. 

So substituting into the expression:

(75 + 117i)(x + iy) + (6 + 9i)(x - iy)

Let me compute each part:

First term: (75 + 117i)(x + iy) = 75x + 75i y + 117i x + 117i² y = 75x + 75i y + 117i x - 117 y

Second term: (6 + 9i)(x - iy) = 6x -6i y +9i x -9i² y = 6x -6i y +9i x +9 y

Adding both terms:

Real parts: 75x - 117y + 6x +9y = (75x +6x) + (-117y +9y) = 81x - 108y

Imaginary parts: 75i y + 117i x -6i y +9i x = (75y -6y)i + (117x +9x)i = 69y i + 126x i

Wait, but earlier when I did the expansion using polar form, I had Re(E) = 324 cosθ - 432 sinθ. But here, using rectangular coordinates, I get Re(E) = 81x - 108y. Hmm, there's a discrepancy here. Which one is correct?

Wait, let me check again. 

Wait, in the first approach, I had z = 4e^{iθ}, so x = 4 cosθ, y = 4 sinθ. Therefore, substituting into 81x - 108y gives 81*4 cosθ - 108*4 sinθ = 324 cosθ - 432 sinθ. Which matches the previous result. So that's correct. Therefore, both methods agree. 

So the real part is 81x - 108y, with x² + y² = 16. So we need to maximize 81x - 108y subject to x² + y² = 16. 

This is another way to look at it. The maximum of a linear function over a circle is given by the magnitude of the vector times the radius. The maximum of ax + by is sqrt(a² + b²) * r, where r is the radius. Wait, but here the constraint is x² + y² = r². So if we have ax + by, the maximum is sqrt(a² + b²) * r. 

In this case, a = 81, b = -108, and r = 4. Therefore, maximum value is sqrt(81² + (-108)^2) * 4. Let's compute that. 

First, compute 81²: 6561. 108²: 11664. Sum is 6561 + 11664 = 18225. sqrt(18225) is 135. Then multiply by 4: 135 * 4 = 540. Same result as before. 

Therefore, this confirms that the maximum real part is indeed 540. 

So I think this is solid. Both methods lead to the same answer. Therefore, the largest possible real part is 540.
