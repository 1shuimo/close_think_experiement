Okay, let's see. I need to solve the equation log base 2 of x plus log base 2 of (x minus 2) equals 3. Hmm, right. So first, I remember that when you add two logarithms with the same base, you can multiply their arguments. So log2(x) - log2(x-2) is the same as log2(x*(x-2)). So that simplifies the left side to log base 2 of (x squared minus 2x). Then the equation becomes log2(x(x-2)) = 3.

Now, to get rid of the logarithm, I can rewrite this in exponential form. Since log base 2 of something equals 3 means that 2^3 equals that something. So 2^3 is 8. Therefore, x(x - 2) = 8. Expanding that, x squared minus 2x equals 8. Then I can bring all terms to one side to form a quadratic equation: x² - 2x - 8 = 0.

Next, solving the quadratic equation. Let's factor it. Looking for two numbers that multiply to -8 and add to -2. Hmm, factors of -8 could be -4 and 2. Yes, because -4 * 2 = -8 and -4 + 2 = -2. So the equation factors to (x - 4)(x + 2) = 0. Therefore, the solutions are x = 4 and x = -2.

But wait, I need to check if these solutions are valid in the original logarithmic equation. Logarithms are only defined for positive arguments. So for log2(x) and log2(x-2), x must be greater than 2. Because x has to be positive, and x-2 also has to be positive. So x > 2. Checking x = 4: 4 is greater than 2, so that's valid. Checking x = -2: -2 is not greater than 2, so that would make x-2 = -4, which is negative. Therefore, x = -2 is an extraneous solution and must be rejected. So the only valid solution is x = 4.

Let me double-check by plugging x = 4 back into the original equation. log2(4) is 2, and log2(4 - 2) is log2(2) which is 1. Adding them together gives 2 + 1 = 3, which matches the right side of the equation. So that works. Therefore, the solution is 4.

I may be uncertain here, so I will briefly re-check only the most recent local steps, verify math, logic, signs, and units, make only minimal fixes, and continue exactly from this point by finishing the interrupted sentence or step immediately before this injected <think> without restarting or repeating earlier long text, while strictly keeping the required output format. Let me start thinking.

The solution to the equation $ \log_2(x) + \log_2(x - 2) = 3 $ is **4**. 

**Step-by-Step Explanation:**

1. **Combine Logarithms:**  
   Use the logarithmic identity $ \log_b(a) + \log_b(c) = \log_b(ac) $:  
   $$
   \log_2(x(x - 2)) = 3
   $$

2. **Convert to Exponential Form:**  
   Rewrite the equation in exponential form:  
   $$
   x(x - 2) = 2^3 = 8
   $$

3. **Solve the Quadratic Equation:**  
   Expand and rearrange:  
   $$
   x^2 - 2x - 8 = 0
   $$  
   Factor:  
   $$
   (x - 4)(x + 2) = 0 \implies x = 4 \text{ or } x = -2
   $$

4. **Check Validity of Solutions:**  
   Logarithms require positive arguments:  
   - For $ x = 4 $: $ x > 0 $ and $ x - 2 = 2 > 0 $ → **Valid**.  
   - For $ x = -2 $: $ x < 0 $ and $ x - 2 = -4 < 0 $ → **Invalid**.

5. **Verify the Solution:**  
   Substitute $ x = 4 $ into the original equation:  
   $$
   \log_2(4) + \log_2(2) = 2 + 1 = 3
   $$  
   The equation holds true.

**Final Answer:**  
$$
\boxed{4}
