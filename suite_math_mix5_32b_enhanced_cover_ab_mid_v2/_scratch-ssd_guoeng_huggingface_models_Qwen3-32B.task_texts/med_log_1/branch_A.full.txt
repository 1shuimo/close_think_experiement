Okay, let's see. I need to solve the equation log base 2 of x plus log base 2 of (x minus 2) equals 3. Hmm, right. So first, I remember that when you add two logarithms with the same base, you can multiply their arguments. So log2(x) - log2(x-2) is the same as log2(x*(x-2)). So that simplifies the left side to log base 2 of (x squared minus 2x). Then the equation becomes log2(x(x-2)) = 3.

Now, to get rid of the logarithm, I can rewrite this in exponential form. Since log base 2 of something equals 3 means that 2^3 equals that something. So 2^3 is 8. Therefore, x(x - 2) = 8. Expanding that, x squared minus 2x equals 8. Then I can bring all terms to one side to form a quadratic equation: x² - 2x - 8 = 0.

Next, solving the quadratic equation. Let's factor it. Looking for two numbers that multiply to -8 and add to -2. Hmm, factors of -8 could be -4 and 2. Yes, because -4 * 2 = -8 and -4 + 2 = -2. So the equation factors to (x - 4)(x + 2) = 0. Therefore, the solutions are x = 4 and x = -2.

But wait, I need to check if these solutions are valid in the original logarithmic equation. Logarithms are only defined for positive arguments. So for log2(x) and log2(x-2), x must be greater than 2. Because x has to be positive, and x-2 also has to be positive. So x > 2. Checking x = 4: 4 is greater than 2, so that's valid. Checking x = -2: -2 is not greater than 2, so that would make x-2 = -4, which is negative. Therefore, x = -2 is an extraneous solution and must be rejected. So the only valid solution is x = 4.

Let me double-check by plugging x = 4 back into the original equation. log2(4) is 2, and log2(4 - 2) is log2(2) which is 1. Adding them together gives 2 + 1 = 3, which matches the right side of the equation. So that works. Therefore, the solution is 4.
