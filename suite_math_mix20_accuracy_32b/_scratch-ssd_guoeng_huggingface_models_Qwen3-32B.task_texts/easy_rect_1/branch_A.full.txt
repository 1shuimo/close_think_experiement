Okay, let's see. The problem is about a rectangle with a perimeter of 70 and a length of 22. I need to find its area. Hmm, right. The perimeter of a rectangle is calculated as 2 times (length plus width). So, if the perimeter is 70, then 2*(length + width) = 70. The length is given as 22, so I can plug that in.

Let me write that out: 2*(22 + width) = 70. To find the width, I should first divide both sides by 2. That would give me 22 + width = 35. Then subtract 22 from both sides to get the width. So, width = 35 - 22 = 13. 

Once I have the width, the area is just length multiplied by width. So, area = 22 * 13. Let me calculate that. 22 times 10 is 220, and 22 times 3 is 66. Adding those together gives 220 + 66 = 286. So the area should be 286. Wait, let me double-check the perimeter calculation to make sure I didn't make a mistake. 

Perimeter is 2*(22 + 13) = 2*(35) = 70. Yep, that matches the given perimeter. So the width is correct. Then the area calculation seems right too. 22*13 is indeed 286. I think that's the answer.
