Okay, let's see. The problem says two-thirds of a number minus 5 equals 19. I need to find the number. Hmm, so first, I should probably set up an equation. Let me call the number x. Then, two-thirds of x would be (2/3)x. Then subtract 5, and that equals 19. So the equation is (2/3)x - 5 = 19. 

Now, to solve for x, I need to isolate it. First, I can add 5 to both sides to get rid of the -5. So adding 5 to both sides gives me (2/3)x = 24. Then, to get x by itself, I need to divide both sides by 2/3, which is the same as multiplying by 3/2. So 24 multiplied by 3/2. Let me calculate that. 24 divided by 2 is 12, and 12 times 3 is 36. So x should be 36. 

Wait, let me check that again. If two-thirds of 36 is 24, then 24 minus 5 is 19. Yeah, that works. So the number is 36. I think that's right. Let me just go through the steps once more to make sure I didn't make any mistakes. Starting with (2/3)x -5 =19. Add 5: (2/3)x=24. Multiply by 3/2: x=24*(3/2)=36. Yep, that's correct. The answer should be 36.

I may be uncertain here, so I will quickly re-check this part.
I will think briefly, only on the most recent local steps.
I will verify math/logic/signs/units, make only minimal fixes, and continue exactly from this point.
I will resume from the text immediately before this injected <think>, finishing the interrupted sentence/step first.
I will not restart or repeat long previous text, and I will keep the required output format.

36.0 * 2/3 = 24.0. 24.0 - 5 = 19.0. All steps verify. Final answer is 36. 

36.0 * 2/3 = 24.0. 24.0 - 5 = 19.0. All steps verify. Final answer is 36.
