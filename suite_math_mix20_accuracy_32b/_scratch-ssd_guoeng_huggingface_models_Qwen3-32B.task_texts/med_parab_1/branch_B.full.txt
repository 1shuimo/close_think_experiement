Okay, so I need to find the minimum value of the quadratic function y = x² - 6x + 5. Hmm, let me think. Quadratic functions have either a minimum or maximum point depending on the coefficient of x². Since the coefficient here is positive (1), the parabola opens upwards, which means it has a minimum point. 

Right, the vertex of the parabola gives the minimum value in this case. The vertex formula for a quadratic y = ax² + bx + c is at x = -b/(2a). Let me apply that here. Here, a is 1 and b is -6. Plugging into the formula: x = -(-6)/(2*1) = 6/2 = 3. So the x-coordinate of the vertex is 3.

Now, to find the corresponding y-value, I substitute x = 3 back into the equation. Let's do that step by step. y = (3)² - 6*(3) + 5. Calculating each term: 3 squared is 9, 6 times 3 is 18, so 9 - 18 is -9, and then adding 5 gives -4. So y = -4 when x = 3. 

Wait, let me double-check that substitution to make sure I didn't make a mistake. 3 squared is indeed 9. Then, -6 times 3 is -18. Adding 5 to that sum: 9 - 18 is -9, plus 5 is -4. Yep, that seems right. So the minimum value of y is -4. 

Alternatively, I could complete the square to confirm. Let's try that method. Starting with y = x² - 6x + 5. To complete the square, take the coefficient of x, which is -6, divide by 2 to get -3, then square it to get 9. So, y = (x² - 6x + 9) - 9 + 5. That simplifies to y = (x - 3)² - 4. The vertex form is y = (x - 3)² - 4, so the vertex is at (3, -4), confirming the minimum value is -4. 

Another way is using calculus, but since the user probably expects an algebraic method, the vertex formula or completing the square should suffice. Both methods give the same result, so I'm confident the minimum value is -4.

I may be uncertain here, so I will quickly re-check this part.
I will think briefly, only on the most recent local steps.
I will verify math/logic/signs/units, make only minimal fixes, and continue exactly from this point.
I will resume from the text immediately before this injected <think>, finishing the interrupted sentence/step first.
I will not restart or repeat long previous text, and I will keep the required output format.

-4. The minimum value of the quadratic function $ y = x^2 - 6x + 5 $ is $-4$, found by completing the square or using the vertex formula $ x = \frac{-b}{2a} $. Substituting $ x = 3 $ into the equation confirms $ y = -4 $. 

**Final Answer**
-4
