Okay, let's see. So the problem is about chickens and rabbits. There are 35 animals in total, and they have 94 legs altogether. I need to find out how many rabbits there are. Hmm, right. Chickens have 2 legs each, and rabbits have 4 legs each. 

Let me start by setting up some equations. Let's let the number of chickens be C and the number of rabbits be R. So, the first equation would be C + R = 35 because there are 35 animals total. Then, for the legs, chickens have 2 legs and rabbits 4, so 2C + 4R = 94. 

Now, I need to solve these two equations. Maybe I can use substitution. From the first equation, I can express C as 35 - R. Then substitute that into the second equation. Let's try that. 

So substituting C = 35 - R into the legs equation: 2*(35 - R) + 4R = 94. Let's compute that. 2*35 is 70, and 2*(-R) is -2R. So the equation becomes 70 - 2R + 4R = 94. Combining like terms, that's 70 + 2R = 94. Then subtract 70 from both sides: 2R = 24. Dividing both sides by 2 gives R = 12. 

Wait, so that would mean there are 12 rabbits. Let me check if that makes sense. If there are 12 rabbits, then there are 35 - 12 = 23 chickens. The legs from chickens would be 23*2 = 46, and legs from rabbits would be 12*4 = 48. Adding those together, 46 + 48 = 94. Yep, that matches the total legs given. So that seems right. 

But wait, let me make sure I didn't make any calculation errors. Let me go through the steps again. Starting with C + R = 35. Then 2C + 4R = 94. Substitute C = 35 - R into the second equation: 2*(35 - R) + 4R = 94. 2*35 is 70, 2*(-R) is -2R. So 70 - 2R + 4R = 70 + 2R = 94. Subtract 70: 2R = 24. R = 12. Yep, same result. And checking the numbers again: 12 rabbits (48 legs) and 23 chickens (46 legs) sum to 94. All checks out. So the answer should be 12 rabbits.
