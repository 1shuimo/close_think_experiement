Okay, let's see. The problem says a number is increased by 20% and becomes 84. I need to find the original number. Hmm, percentage increases can sometimes trip me up. So, if the original number is increased by 20%, that means the new number is 120% of the original, right? Because 100% of the original plus 20% more.

So, if I let the original number be x, then increasing it by 20% would be x multiplied by 1.2. And that equals 84. So the equation would be 1.2x = 84. To find x, I need to divide both sides by 1.2. Let me do that calculation. 84 divided by 1.2. Hmm, 1.2 times 70 is 84, because 1.2 times 70 is 84. Wait, is that right? Let me check. 1.2 times 70: 1 times 70 is 70, 0.2 times 70 is 14, so 70 +14=84. Yes, that works. So the original number must be 70. 

Wait, but let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in setting up the equation. The problem says the number is increased by 20%, so 20% of the original is added. So 20% of x is 0.2x, so the new number is x + 0.2x = 1.2x. That's correct. So 1.2x =84, so x=84/1.2=70. Yeah, that seems right. I think that's the answer.
