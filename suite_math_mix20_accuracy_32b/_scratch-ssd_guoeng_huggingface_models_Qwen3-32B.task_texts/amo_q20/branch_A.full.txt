Okay, let's try to solve this problem step by step. So, there are three classes in a school. The condition is that for any two students from different classes, in the third class, there are exactly 10 students who know both of them and 10 who know neither. We need to find the total number of students across all three classes.

First, let me parse the problem again. Let's denote the three classes as A, B, and C. Suppose we take two students, one from class A and another from class B. Then, in class C, there are exactly 10 students who know both of these students, and 10 who know neither. Similarly, this condition should hold for any pair of students from different classes. So, if we take a student from A and one from C, then in class B, there should be 10 students who know both and 10 who know neither. Same for a student from B and C in class A.

Hmm. This seems like a problem that might involve some combinatorial design or graph theory. Maybe each class has a certain number of students, and the relationships between them (knowing each other) are structured in a particular way.

Let me think about how to model this. Let's assume each class has the same number of students, maybe? Because the problem is symmetric for all three classes. Let me denote the number of students in each class as n. So total students would be 3n, which is what we need to find.

Now, take two students from different classes, say one from A and one from B. In class C, there are 10 students who know both, and 10 who know neither. Since class C has n students, the total number of students in C is n. So, the number of students who know both is 10, the number who know neither is 10, so the remaining students in C must know exactly one of the two students. Let me check that.

Total students in C: n. So, 10 know both, 10 know neither. Then the rest, which is n - 10 -10 = n - 20, must be those who know exactly one of the two students. Wait, but how does that relate to the problem?

Alternatively, maybe we can model the "knowing" relationship as a graph. Each student is a node, and an edge exists if they know each other. But since the problem involves students from different classes, perhaps we need to consider bipartite graphs between classes?

Wait, but the problem is about students in different classes and how others in the third class know them. Let me think again. Suppose we have two students, x in A and y in B. For the third class, which is C, each student in C can have four possibilities regarding knowing x and y: knows both, knows x but not y, knows y but not x, knows neither. The problem states that exactly 10 know both and 10 know neither. So, the number of students in C who know exactly one of x or y is n - 20.

But how does this help us? Maybe we need to find some relations between the number of students and the number of acquaintances.

Alternatively, maybe we can use some counting arguments. Let's consider the number of pairs of students from different classes and how they relate to the third class.

Let me think about the total number of pairs of students from different classes. Since there are three classes, each pair of classes contributes some number of pairs. For example, between A and B, there are n * n pairs (each student in A paired with each in B). Similarly for A and C, and B and C. So total cross-class pairs would be 3n².

But for each such pair (from different classes), in the third class, there are 10 students who know both and 10 who know neither. Let me think about how this relates to the structure of the graph.

Alternatively, maybe we can model this using linear algebra or some combinatorial equations. Let me try to think of it in terms of design theory. For example, in a symmetric design, certain intersection properties hold. But I'm not sure if that's directly applicable here.

Wait, let's take a specific example. Let's take a student x in class A. How many students in class B does x know? Let me denote that as k. Similarly, for any student in A, they know k students in B, and maybe k students in C? But the problem is about knowing students in other classes, but the exact relationships might be symmetric.

But how does the given condition translate into equations? Let's consider two students from different classes, say x in A and y in B. In class C, there are 10 students who know both x and y. Let me denote the number of common acquaintances in C as 10. Similarly, there are 10 who know neither. 

Now, if I fix x in A and y in B, then for each student z in C, z knows x and y, or z knows x but not y, etc. The count for knowing both is 10. Let me think about how to relate this to the number of common friends between x and y. Wait, in graph theory terms, the number of common neighbors of x and y is 10. Similarly, the number of students in C who are not neighbors of either x or y is 10. 

But x is in A, y is in B, and the common neighbors are in C. So, for any pair of students from different classes, their number of common neighbors in the third class is 10. Also, the number of students in the third class who are not neighbors of either is 10. 

This seems like a very structured condition. Maybe this is similar to a strongly regular graph, but across three classes. 

Alternatively, perhaps we can use some equations. Let me assume that each class has n students. Let me consider the number of common neighbors between two students from different classes. Let me take x in A and y in B. The number of common neighbors in C is 10. Similarly, if I take x in A and z in C, then the number of common neighbors in B is 10. 

Now, let's think about the total number of common neighbors across all pairs. Let me try to count in two ways. 

First, for each pair of students from different classes, there are 10 common neighbors in the third class. How many such pairs are there? For each pair of classes, there are n * n pairs. There are three pairs of classes (A-B, A-C, B-C). So total number of cross-class pairs is 3n². Each such pair has 10 common neighbors in the third class. Therefore, the total number of triples (x, y, z) where x is in one class, y in another, z in the third, and z knows both x and y is 3n² * 10.

On the other hand, let's count this total in another way. For each student z in a class, how many pairs (x, y) from the other two classes does z know both? Let's say z is in class C. Then, x is in A and y is in B. Suppose that z knows a students in A and b students in B. Then, the number of pairs (x, y) where z knows both is a * b. Similarly, for each student z in C, the number of such pairs is a * b. 

But since the problem is symmetric, perhaps each student in a class knows the same number of students in each of the other two classes. Let me assume that each student knows k students in each of the other two classes. So, for a student in class C, they know k students in A and k students in B. Therefore, the number of pairs (x, y) where x is in A, y is in B, and z knows both is k * k = k². 

Since there are n students in each class, the total number of such triples (x, y, z) would be, for each class, n * k². Since there are three classes, total is 3n * k². 

But earlier, we had that this total is 3n² * 10. Therefore, equating the two expressions:

3n * k² = 3n² * 10

Divide both sides by 3n:

k² = 10n

So, k² = 10n. Therefore, k must be an integer, and 10n must be a perfect square. Therefore, n must be a multiple of 10, and such that 10n is a square. Let me note that.

But we also have another condition: for any two students from different classes, in the third class, there are 10 students who know neither. Let me try to use that.

Again, take two students x in A and y in B. In class C, there are 10 students who know neither x nor y. The total number of students in C is n. So, the number of students who know at least one of x or y is n - 10. 

But the number of students who know at least one of x or y can also be calculated using inclusion-exclusion. Let me denote:

Number who know x or y = number who know x + number who know y - number who know both x and y.

We already know that the number who know both is 10. 

Let me denote that for a student x in A, the number of students in C who know x is k (since each student in A knows k students in C, and by symmetry, each student in C knows k students in A). Wait, but actually, if each student in A knows k students in B and k in C, then for a student x in A, the number of students in C who know x would be... Wait, maybe I need to think about the direction here.

Wait, if each student in class C knows k students in A and k in B, then for a student x in A, how many students in C know x? Let me think. Each student in C knows k students in A. There are n students in C. So total number of "knowing" relationships from C to A is n * k. On the other hand, for each student in A, the number of students in C who know them would be (n * k)/n = k. Because there are n students in A, so if the total is n*k, then each student in A is known by k students in C. Therefore, for a student x in A, the number of students in C who know x is k. Similarly for a student y in B, the number of students in C who know y is k. 

Therefore, going back to inclusion-exclusion:

Number who know x or y in C is equal to k + k - 10 = 2k - 10. 

But we also know that this number is n - 10. Therefore:

2k - 10 = n - 10

Simplify:

2k = n

So, n = 2k.

Earlier, we had k² = 10n. Substituting n = 2k into that:

k² = 10*(2k) => k² = 20k => k² - 20k = 0 => k(k - 20) = 0.

Since k can't be 0 (otherwise, students wouldn't know anyone in other classes, but we have 10 students who know both, which would be impossible), so k = 20. Then, n = 2k = 40.

Therefore, each class has 40 students, so total number of students is 3*40 = 120.

Wait, let me check if this works. Let me verify with the numbers.

If n = 40, then k = 20. Each student knows 20 students in each of the other two classes. 

Take two students x (in A) and y (in B). In class C, the number of students who know both x and y is 10. Let's check that. For each student in C, they know 20 students in A and 20 in B. The total number of pairs (x, y) where x is in A and y in B that a student in C knows both is 20*20 = 400. But how does this relate to the total?

Wait, earlier we had that the total number of triples (x, y, z) where z knows both x and y is 3n² * 10. Let's compute that with n=40: 3*(40)^2 *10 = 3*1600*10 = 48,000.

On the other hand, the other way: for each class, n * k². Since n=40, k=20, so 40*(20)^2 = 40*400 = 16,000. Multiply by 3 classes: 48,000. Which matches. So that checks out.

Also, for the other condition: for x in A and y in B, in class C, the number who know neither is 10. Let's check that. The number who know x is 20, the number who know y is 20, and the number who know both is 10. So using inclusion-exclusion, the number who know x or y is 20 + 20 - 10 = 30. Therefore, the number who know neither is 40 - 30 = 10. Which matches the condition. So that works.

Therefore, n=40 per class, total 120 students. So the answer should be 120.

But let me check if there are any other constraints or possible mistakes. For example, does each student in a class knowing 20 students in each of the other classes make sense? For example, in class A, each student knows 20 in B and 20 in C. Since there are 40 students in B, each student in A knows half of them. Similarly for C. 

Is there any other condition that needs to be satisfied? For example, if we take two students from the same class, but the problem states the condition is for any two students from different classes. So maybe that's okay.

Another check: Let's take a student in class A. They know 20 students in B and 20 in C. How many total acquaintances do they have? 40. But since there are two other classes, each with 40 students, so total possible is 80. So they don't know 40 students. That seems possible.

Another angle: Let's think about the total number of edges between classes. Between A and B, each of the 40 students in A knows 20 in B, so total edges from A to B is 40*20 = 800. Similarly, edges from A to C is 800, and from B to C is 800. Total edges across all classes: 2400. 

But each edge is counted twice if we consider both directions? Wait, no, if we're considering directed edges (knowing is mutual?), the problem says "know both of them" and "know neither of them", implying that the knowing relationship is mutual. So it's an undirected graph. Therefore, the total number of edges between A and B is 800, but since each edge is between one in A and one in B, that's correct. 

But let me check if there's any inconsistency. For example, take a student in B. They have 20 students they know in A and 20 in C. So total edges from B to A is 40*20=800, same as from A to B. Which is consistent. So no problem there.

Therefore, all conditions seem to be satisfied with n=40. Hence, the total number of students is 3*40=120.

### The final answer is: $\boxed{120}$
</think>

To solve the problem, we analyze the structure of the relationships between students in three classes, denoted as $ A $, $ B $, and $ C $, under the given condition:

> For any two students from different classes, in the third class, there are exactly 10 students who know both of them and 10 who know neither.

---

### Step 1: Model the Problem

Let each class have $ n $ students. The total number of students is then $ 3n $, which is the quantity we aim to find.

Suppose a student $ x \in A $ and a student $ y \in B $. In class $ C $, the number of students who know both $ x $ and $ y $ is 10, and the number who know neither is also 10. Thus, the number of students in $ C $ who know **exactly one** of $ x $ or $ y $ is:

$$
n - 10 - 10 = n - 20
$$

This applies symmetrically to all such pairs from different classes.

---

### Step 2: Use Inclusion-Exclusion

Let $ k $ be the number of students in class $ C $ that a student in class $ A $ knows. Then, the number of students in $ C $ who know $ x \in A $ is $ k $, and similarly for $ y \in B $.

Using the inclusion-exclusion principle, the number of students in $ C $ who know **either** $ x $ or $ y $ is:

$$
k + k - \text{(number who know both)} = 2k - 10
$$

But we also know that the number of students in $ C $ who know **either** $ x $ or $ y $ is:

$$
n - 10
$$

Equating the two expressions:

$$
2k - 10 = n - 10 \Rightarrow 2k = n
$$

---

### Step 3: Use the Known-Both Condition

From the earlier condition, for any pair $ x \in A $, $ y \in B $, the number of students in $ C $ who know both is 10. Let’s count the total number of such triples $ (x, y, z) $, where $ x \in A $, $ y \in B $, and $ z \in C $, and $ z $ knows both $ x $ and $ y $.

There are $ n^2 $ such pairs $ (x, y) $, and for each, 10 students in $ C $ know both. So the total number of such triples is:

$$
3n^2 \cdot 10
$$

On the other hand, for each student $ z \in C $, they know $ k $ students in $ A $ and $ k $ in $ B $, so the number of such pairs $ (x, y) $ for which $ z $ knows both is $ k^2 $. Since there are $ n $ students in $ C $, the total number of such triples is:

$$
n \cdot k^2
$$

Equating the two expressions:

$$
n \cdot k^2 = 3n^2 \cdot 10 \Rightarrow k^2 = 30n
$$

---

### Step 4: Solve the System

We now have two equations:

1. $ 2k = n $
2. $ k^2 = 30n $

Substitute $ n = 2k $ into the second equation:

$$
k^2 = 30(2k) \Rightarrow k^2 = 60k \Rightarrow k(k - 60) = 0
$$

Since $ k \neq 0 $, we have $ k = 60 $, and thus $ n = 2k = 120 $.

---

### Final Answer

Each class has 120 students, so the total number of students across all three classes is:

$$
3 \cdot 120 = \boxed{360}
$$

### The final answer is: $\boxed{360}$
