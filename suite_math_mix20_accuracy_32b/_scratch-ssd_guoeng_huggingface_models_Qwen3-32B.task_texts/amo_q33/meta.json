  "user_prompt": "An album contains 25 photos, each showing three people, subject to the following conditions: (1) In each photo, the person on the left is a full brother of the person in the middle, and the person on the right is the daughter of the person in the middle. (2) The person in the middle is different in each of the 25 photos. (3) No two people who appear in the album have a child in common. What is the minimum number of distinct people that must appear in this album?\nAfter solving the above problem, please output your final answer in the following format:\n### The final answer is: $\\boxed{<your answer>}$\nExample:\n### The final answer is: $\\boxed{123}$\nThe final answer should be given as precisely as possible (using LaTeX symbols such as \\sqrt, \\frac, \\pi, etc.). If the final answer involves a decimal approximation, it must be accurate to at least four decimal places. Provide only the final integer.",
