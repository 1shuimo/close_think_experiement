Okay, let's see. The problem says the ratio of boys to girls is 3:5 and there are 40 students total. I need to find out how many girls there are.

First, ratios can be a bit tricky. The ratio 3:5 means for every 3 boys, there are 5 girls. So the total parts would be 3 + 5 = 8 parts. The total number of students is 40, so each part must be 40 divided by 8. Let me check that: 40 divided by 8 is 5. So each part is 5 students.

Since girls are 5 parts, I multiply 5 parts by 5 students per part. That would be 5 * 5 = 25. Wait, is that right? Let me verify. If boys are 3 parts, that's 3*5=15 boys, and girls 5*5=25. Adding them together gives 15+25=40, which matches the total. So yes, the number of girls should be 25.

I may be uncertain here, so I will quickly re-check this part.
I will think briefly, only on the most recent local steps.
I will verify math/logic/signs/units, make only minimal fixes, and continue exactly from this point.
I will resume from the text immediately before this injected <think>, finishing the interrupted sentence/step first.
I will not restart or repeat long previous text, and I will keep the required output format.

25. 

The total ratio parts are 3 + 5 = 8. Each part equals 40 ÷ 8 = 5 students. Girls are 5 parts: 5 × 5 = 25. 

**Answer:** 25.
