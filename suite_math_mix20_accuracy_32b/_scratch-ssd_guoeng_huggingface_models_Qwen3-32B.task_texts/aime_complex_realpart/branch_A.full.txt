Okay, let's try to solve this problem step by step. The question is asking for the largest possible real part of the expression [(75 + 117i)z + (96 + 144i)/z] where z is a complex number with |z| = 4. Hmm, so z is a complex number on the circle with radius 4 centered at the origin. 

First, I remember that when dealing with complex numbers and their magnitudes, sometimes it's helpful to express them in polar form. Since |z| = 4, we can write z as 4e^{iθ}, where �� is the argument of z. That might make things easier because then 1/z would be 1/(4e^{iθ}) = (1/4)e^{-iθ}. 

So substituting z = 4e^{iθ} into the expression, let's see:

The first term is (75 + 117i)z. Substituting z gives (75 + 117i)*4e^{iθ} = 4*(75 + 117i)e^{iθ}.

The second term is (96 + 144i)/z. Substituting z gives (96 + 144i)/(4e^{iθ}) = (24 + 36i)e^{-iθ}.

So the entire expression becomes 4*(75 + 117i)e^{iθ} + (24 + 36i)e^{-iθ}.

Now, we need to find the real part of this expression. Let's denote A = 4*(75 + 117i) and B = (24 + 36i). Then the expression is A e^{iθ} + B e^{-iθ}. The real part of this would be Re(A e^{iθ} + B e^{-iθ}).

To compute this, I can expand A and B into their real and imaginary parts. Let's compute A first:

A = 4*(75 + 117i) = 300 + 468i.

B = 24 + 36i.

So the expression is (300 + 468i)e^{iθ} + (24 + 36i)e^{-iθ}.

Now, let's express e^{iθ} as cosθ + i sinθ and e^{-iθ} as cosθ - i sinθ. Then multiplying out:

First term: (300 + 468i)(cosθ + i sinθ) = 300 cosθ + 300 i sinθ + 468i cosθ + 468i^2 sinθ. Since i^2 = -1, this becomes 300 cosθ + 300i sinθ + 468i cosθ - 468 sinθ.

Similarly, the second term: (24 + 36i)(cosθ - i sinθ) = 24 cosθ - 24i sinθ + 36i cosθ - 36i^2 sinθ. Again, i^2 = -1, so this becomes 24 cosθ -24i sinθ + 36i cosθ + 36 sinθ.

Now, combining both terms:

First term's real parts: 300 cosθ - 468 sinθ.

First term's imaginary parts: 300 sinθ + 468 cosθ.

Second term's real parts: 24 cosθ + 36 sinθ.

Second term's imaginary parts: -24 sinθ + 36 cosθ.

Adding the real parts together: (300 cosθ - 468 sinθ) + (24 cosθ + 36 sinθ) = (300 + 24) cosθ + (-468 + 36) sinθ = 324 cosθ - 432 sinθ.

Adding the imaginary parts together: (300 sinθ + 468 cosθ) + (-24 sinθ + 36 cosθ) = (300 -24) sinθ + (468 + 36) cosθ = 276 sinθ + 504 cosθ. But since we're only interested in the real part of the entire expression, we can ignore the imaginary parts.

So the real part of the entire expression is 324 cosθ - 432 sinθ. Wait, that seems a bit off. Let me check my calculations again.

Wait, when I added the real parts: 300 cosθ -468 sinθ +24 cosθ +36 sinθ. So 300 +24 is 324 cosθ, and -468 +36 is -432 sinθ. That's correct. So the real part is 324 cosθ - 432 sinθ. 

Now, the problem is to find the maximum value of this real part. So we need to maximize 324 cosθ - 432 sinθ. 

This is a standard problem of finding the maximum of a linear combination of sine and cosine. The maximum value of A cosθ + B sinθ is sqrt(A² + B²). Wait, but here it's 324 cosθ - 432 sinθ. So it's equivalent to A cosθ + B sinθ where A = 324 and B = -432. Therefore, the maximum value is sqrt(324² + (-432)^2).

Let me compute that. First, compute 324 squared. 324^2: 300^2 = 90000, 24^2 = 576, and cross term 2*300*24=14400. So (300 +24)^2 = 90000 + 14400 + 576 = 104,976. Wait, but 324^2 is actually 324*324. Let me compute it properly. 324*324: 300*300=90000, 300*24*2=14400, 24*24=576. So total is 90000 +14400 +576= 104,976. Correct.

Then (-432)^2 is 432^2. Let's compute 432^2. 400^2=160000, 32^2=1024, and cross term 2*400*32=25600. So (400+32)^2=160000 +25600 +1024= 186,624. 

So sqrt(104,976 + 186,624) = sqrt(291,600). What's sqrt(291600)? Let's see. 500^2=250,000. 540^2=291,600. Yes, because 540*540 = (500 +40)^2 = 500^2 + 2*500*40 +40^2 = 250,000 +40,000 +1,600= 291,600. So sqrt(291,600)=540. 

Therefore, the maximum value of 324 cosθ -432 sinθ is 540. Therefore, the largest possible real part is 540. 

Wait, but let me confirm if I did everything correctly. Let me check the coefficients again. The real part was 324 cosθ -432 sinθ. The maximum of A cosθ + B sinθ is sqrt(A² + B²). So yes, that's correct. So sqrt(324² + (-432)^2) = 540. Therefore, the answer should be 540. 

But let me check if there was a mistake in the earlier steps. Let me retrace. 

Original expression: [(75 +117i)z + (96 +144i)/z]. With |z|=4. 

Expressed z as 4e^{iθ}, so 1/z is (1/4)e^{-iθ}. Then multiplied out:

First term: (75 +117i)*4e^{iθ} = 300 + 468i multiplied by e^{iθ}.

Second term: (96 +144i)/4 e^{-iθ} = 24 +36i multiplied by e^{-iθ}.

Then expanding both terms and taking real parts. 

Yes, that seems correct. Then combining the real parts gives 324 cosθ -432 sinθ. Then maximum is 540. 

But wait, let me check if there's a mistake in the coefficients. Let me recompute the real parts again. 

First term's real part: 300 cosθ -468 sinθ. Second term's real part: 24 cosθ +36 sinθ. Adding them gives 300 +24 = 324 cosθ, and -468 +36 = -432 sinθ. Correct. 

So the maximum is indeed 540. Therefore, the answer is 540. 

But wait, let me check if there's another approach. Maybe using complex analysis or optimization. Alternatively, since z has |z|=4, maybe we can use the fact that for any complex number z with |z|=r, then z + k/z can be maximized or minimized using certain techniques. But in this case, the expression is linear in z and 1/z. 

Alternatively, perhaps we can write the expression as a single term. Let me think. Let me denote w = z, with |w|=4. Then the expression is (75 +117i)w + (96 +144i)/w. Let me factor out something. 

Alternatively, perhaps we can write this as a single complex number multiplied by w and 1/w. But maybe not necessary. 

Alternatively, since we need the real part, maybe we can take the real part of the entire expression. Let me try that approach. 

Let me denote the expression as E = (75 +117i)z + (96 +144i)/z. Then Re(E) = Re[(75 +117i)z] + Re[(96 +144i)/z]. 

Let me compute each term separately. 

First term: Re[(75 +117i)z]. Let me write z as x + iy, where x^2 + y^2 = 16. Then (75 +117i)(x + iy) = 75x +75iy +117i x +117i^2 y = 75x + (75y +117x)i -117y. Therefore, the real part is 75x -117y. 

Second term: Re[(96 +144i)/z]. Since z has |z|=4, then 1/z = conjugate(z)/|z|^2 = (x - iy)/16. Therefore, (96 +144i)/z = (96 +144i)(x - iy)/16. Let me compute that. 

First, compute (96 +144i)(x - iy) = 96x -96i y +144i x -144i^2 y = 96x + (144x -96y)i +144y. Therefore, the real part is 96x +144y. Then divide by 16: (96x +144y)/16 = 6x + 9y. 

Therefore, the total real part of E is (75x -117y) + (6x +9y) = (75x +6x) + (-117y +9y) = 81x -108y. 

Wait, this contradicts my previous result where I had 324 cosθ -432 sinθ. Let me check where I went wrong. 

In the first approach, I converted z to polar form and ended up with 324 cosθ -432 sinθ. In this second approach, using rectangular coordinates, I get 81x -108y. But since x = 4 cosθ and y =4 sinθ (since |z|=4), substituting into 81x -108y gives 81*4 cosθ -108*4 sinθ = 324 cosθ -432 sinθ. Which matches the previous result. So that's correct. 

Therefore, the real part is 81x -108y, which is equivalent to 324 cosθ -432 sinθ. So the maximum value is sqrt( (324)^2 + (-432)^2 ) = 540. 

Therefore, the answer is 540. 

But let me check if there's another way to see this. For example, maybe by using the triangle inequality or other complex number properties. 

Alternatively, since we have Re(E) = 81x -108y, and x^2 + y^2 = 16. So we need to maximize 81x -108y subject to x^2 + y^2 =16. This is a standard optimization problem. The maximum of ax + by over x^2 + y^2 = r^2 is sqrt(a^2 + b^2)*r. Wait, here it's 81x -108y, so a=81, b=-108, and r=4. Then maximum is sqrt(81^2 + (-108)^2)*4. 

Compute that: 81^2 = 6561, 108^2 = 11664. Sum is 6561 + 11664 = 18225. sqrt(18225) = 135. Multiply by 4: 135*4=540. So same result. 

Therefore, this confirms that the maximum is indeed 540. 

Therefore, the answer is 540. 

But let me check if there's any possible mistake in the coefficients. Let me recheck the calculation of Re(E) in the rectangular approach. 

First term: Re[(75 +117i)z] = 75x -117y. 

Second term: Re[(96 +144i)/z] = 6x +9y. 

Adding them gives 75x +6x =81x, and -117y +9y = -108y. Correct. 

So 81x -108y. Then with x^2 + y^2 =16. 

Yes, so maximum is sqrt(81^2 + (-108)^2)*sqrt(16). Wait, no, the formula is maximum value is sqrt(a^2 + b^2) * r, where r is the radius. Wait, in general, for ax + by with x^2 + y^2 = r^2, maximum is sqrt(a^2 + b^2)*r. Wait, no, actually, the maximum is sqrt(a^2 + b^2)*r. Wait, let me recall. 

The maximum of ax + by subject to x^2 + y^2 = r^2 is achieved when (x,y) is in the direction of (a,b). So the maximum value is sqrt(a^2 + b^2)*r. Wait, no, if (x,y) is a unit vector multiplied by r, then the maximum is r*sqrt(a^2 + b^2). Wait, let me think. 

Let me consider the Cauchy-Schwarz inequality: ax + by ≤ sqrt(a^2 + b^2) * sqrt(x^2 + y^2). Since sqrt(x^2 + y^2) is 4, then ax + by ≤ sqrt(a^2 + b^2)*4. Therefore, maximum is 4*sqrt(81^2 + (-108)^2). 

Compute sqrt(81^2 + 108^2). 81 and 108 have a common factor of 27: 81=27*3, 108=27*4. So sqrt( (27^2)(3^2 +4^2)) =27*sqrt(25)=27*5=135. Therefore, 4*135=540. Correct. 

Therefore, this confirms again that the maximum is 540. 

Therefore, the answer is 540. 

I think this is solid. All approaches lead to the same result. So I'm confident the answer is 540.
