Okay, let's see. The problem is about finding the 20th term of an arithmetic sequence where the first term is 7 and the common difference is 3. Hmm, arithmetic sequences... right, each term is the previous term plus the common difference. The formula for the nth term of an arithmetic sequence is a_n = a_1 + (n-1)d, where a_1 is the first term, d is the common difference, and n is the term number.

So here, a_1 is 7, d is 3, and n is 20. Plugging those into the formula: a_20 = 7 + (20-1)*3. Let's compute that step by step. First, 20-1 is 19. Then multiply that by 3: 19*3. Let me calculate that. 19*3 is 57. Then add the first term, 7. So 57 + 7 equals 64. Therefore, the 20th term should be 64. Wait, let me double-check. If the first term is 7, the second term is 10, third is 13, and so on. Each term increases by 3. So the 20th term would be 7 + 3*(19) which is indeed 7 + 57 = 64. Yeah, that seems right. I don't think I made any calculation errors here. The answer should be 64.
