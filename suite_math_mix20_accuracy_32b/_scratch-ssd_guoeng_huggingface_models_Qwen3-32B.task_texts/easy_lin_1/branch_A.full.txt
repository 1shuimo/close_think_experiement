Okay, let's see. I need to solve the equation 7x minus 13 equals 50. Hmm, right. So first, I should probably get rid of that -13 on the left side. To do that, I can add 13 to both sides of the equation. That should help isolate the term with x.

So if I add 13 to both sides, the equation becomes 7x = 50 + 13. Let me calculate 50 plus 13. That's 63. So now it's 7x = 63. 

Now, to solve for x, I need to divide both sides by 7. So x equals 63 divided by 7. Let me do that division. 7 times 9 is 63, so 63 divided by 7 is 9. Therefore, x should be 9. 

Wait, let me double-check. If I plug x = 9 back into the original equation: 7 times 9 is 63, minus 13 is 50. Yep, that matches the right side of the equation. So that's correct. I think that's all. The answer is 9.
