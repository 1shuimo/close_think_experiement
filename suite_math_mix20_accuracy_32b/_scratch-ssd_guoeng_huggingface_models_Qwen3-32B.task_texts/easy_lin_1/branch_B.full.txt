Okay, let's see. I need to solve the equation 7x minus 13 equals 50. Hmm, right. So first, I should probably get rid of that -13 on the left side. To do that, I can add 13 to both sides of the equation. That should help isolate the term with x.

So if I add 13 to both sides, the equation becomes 7x = 50 + 13. Let me calculate 50 plus 13. That's 63. So now it's 7x = 63. 

Now, to solve for x, I need to divide both sides by 7. So x equals 63 divided by 7. Let me do that division. 7 times 9 is 63, so 63 divided by 7 is 9. Therefore, x should be 9. 

Wait, let me double-check. If I plug x = 9 back into the original equation: 7 times 9 is 63, minus 13 is 50. Yep, that matches the right side of the equation. So that's correct. I think that's all. The answer is 9.

I may be uncertain here, so I will quickly re-check this part.
I will think briefly, only on the most recent local steps.
I will verify math/logic/signs/units, make only minimal fixes, and continue exactly from this point.
I will resume from the text immediately before this injected <think>, finishing the interrupted sentence/step first.
I will not restart or repeat long previous text, and I will keep the required output format.

13 to both sides:  
7x = 63  
Divide both sides by 7:  
x = 9  

**Final Answer**
9.  

**Step-by-Step Explanation**  
1. Start with the equation:  
   $ 7x - 13 = 50 $  
2. Add 13 to both sides to isolate the term with $ x $:  
   $ 7x = 50 + 13 $  
   $ 7x = 63 $  
3. Divide both sides by 7 to solve for $ x $:  
   $ x = \frac{63}{7} $  
   $ x = 9 $  

**Answer:** 9
