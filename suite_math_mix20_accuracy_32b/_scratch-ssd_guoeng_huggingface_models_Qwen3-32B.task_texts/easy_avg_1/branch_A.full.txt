Okay, let's see. I need to find the value of x such that the average of the five numbers 12, 15, 9, 18, and x is 14. Hmm, averages can be tricky sometimes, but I think the formula for average is the sum of the numbers divided by the number of numbers. So here, there are five numbers, and their average is 14. That means the total sum should be 5 times 14. Let me write that down.

First, calculate the total sum needed: 5 * 14 = 70. Now, the sum of the known numbers is 12 + 15 + 9 + 18. Let me add those up. 12 plus 15 is 27, plus 9 is 36, plus 18 is 54. So the sum of the four numbers is 54. Then, adding x to that should equal 70. So, 54 + x = 70. To find x, subtract 54 from 70. 70 minus 54 is 16. Wait, is that right? Let me check my math again. 12 + 15 is 27, plus 9 is 36, plus 18 is 54. Yes, that's correct. Then 5*14 is 70. So 70 - 54 is indeed 16. So x must be 16. I think that's the answer. Let me just make sure I didn't make any addition errors. 12 + 15 is 27, plus 9 is 36, plus 18 is 54. Yep, that's right. And 5 times 14 is 70. So 70 minus 54 is 16. Yeah, that seems correct. I don't see any mistakes here. So x is 16.
