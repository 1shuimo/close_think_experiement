Okay, let's see. The problem is about finding the total travel time for a car that goes 120 km at 60 km/h and then 60 km at 40 km/h. I need to calculate the time taken for each part and add them up.

First part: 120 km at 60 km/h. Time is distance divided by speed, so 120 divided by 60. That should be 2 hours. Then the second part is 60 km at 40 km/h. So 60 divided by 40. Hmm, that's 1.5 hours. Adding both times: 2 + 1.5 equals 3.5 hours. But the answer needs to be in minutes. So 3.5 hours multiplied by 60 minutes per hour. 3 times 60 is 180, plus 0.5 times 60 is 30, so total 210 minutes. Wait, let me check again. 120/60 is 2 hours, correct. 60/40 is 1.5 hours, right. Total 3.5 hours. 3.5 * 60 = 210. Yeah, that seems right. So the final answer should be 210.
