Okay, let's try to solve this problem step by step. The problem says that sin(theta) + cos(theta) equals sqrt(2)/2, and we need to find 100 times sin(2theta), then provide the final integer. Hmm, okay.

First, I remember that there's a trigonometric identity for sin(2theta), which is 2 sin(theta) cos(theta). So if I can find sin(theta) cos(theta), then multiplying by 2 and then by 100 should give me the answer. But how do I find sin(theta) cos(theta) from the given equation?

The given equation is sin(theta) + cos(theta) = sqrt(2)/2. Maybe I can square both sides to use the identity (sin(theta) + cos(theta))² = sin²(theta) + 2 sin(theta) cos(theta) + cos²(theta). Since sin²(theta) + cos²(theta) equals 1, that simplifies things. Let me try that.

Squaring both sides: (sin(theta) + cos(theta))² = (sqrt(2)/2)². The left side becomes sin²(theta) + 2 sin(theta) cos(theta) + cos²(theta), which is 1 + 2 sin(theta) cos(theta). The right side is (2)/4, which is 1/2. So:

1 + 2 sin(theta) cos(theta) = 1/2.

Subtracting 1 from both sides: 2 sin(theta) cos(theta) = 1/2 - 1 = -1/2.

Then, sin(theta) cos(theta) = -1/4.

But wait, sin(2theta) is 2 sin(theta) cos(theta), so that would be 2*(-1/4) = -1/2. Then multiplying by 100 gives -50. But the problem says to provide the final integer. However, negative numbers are integers, so maybe -50 is the answer. But I need to check if there's a mistake here.

Wait, let me verify the steps again. Starting with squaring both sides:

Original equation: sin(theta) + cos(theta) = sqrt(2)/2.

Square both sides: [sin(theta) + cos(theta)]² = (sqrt(2)/2)².

Left side: sin²(theta) + 2 sin(theta) cos(theta) + cos²(theta) = 1 + 2 sin(theta) cos(theta).

Right side: (sqrt(2))² / (2²) = 2/4 = 1/2.

So 1 + 2 sin(theta) cos(theta) = 1/2.

Subtract 1: 2 sin(theta) cos(theta) = -1/2.

Therefore, sin(2theta) = -1/2. Then 100 * sin(2theta) = 100 * (-1/2) = -50. So the answer is -50. But the problem says to provide the final integer. Since -50 is an integer, that should be correct. But maybe I made a mistake in the calculation? Let me check again.

Alternatively, maybe there's another approach. Let me think. Suppose I use substitution. Let me set sin(theta) + cos(theta) = sqrt(2)/2. Let me denote x = theta. Then, maybe express sin(x) + cos(x) as sqrt(2) sin(x + 45°), since there's an identity that a sin(x) + b cos(x) = sqrt(a² + b²) sin(x + phi). In this case, a=1, b=1, so sqrt(2) sin(x + 45°). Therefore, sqrt(2) sin(x + 45°) = sqrt(2)/2. Dividing both sides by sqrt(2) gives sin(x + 45°) = 1/2. Then, x + 45° = 30° + 360°n or 150° + 360°n, where n is integer. Therefore, x = -15° + 360°n or 105° + 360°n. Then, sin(2x) would be sin(2*(-15°)) = sin(-30°) = -1/2, or sin(2*105°) = sin(210°) = -1/2. So in both cases, sin(2theta) is -1/2, so 100 times that is -50. So same result. Therefore, the answer is -50. But the problem says to provide the final integer. So -50 is the answer. But maybe the problem expects a positive integer? Wait, the problem didn't specify that. It just says to provide the final integer. So -50 is correct. Therefore, the answer is -50. But let me check once more.

Alternatively, maybe there's a mistake in the squaring step. Let me check. If sin(theta) + cos(theta) = sqrt(2)/2, then squaring gives 1 + 2 sin(theta) cos(theta) = 1/2. Therefore, 2 sin(theta) cos(theta) = -1/2. Therefore, sin(2theta) = -1/2. So 100 * (-1/2) = -50. Yes, that's correct. So the answer is -50. Therefore, the final integer is -50.
