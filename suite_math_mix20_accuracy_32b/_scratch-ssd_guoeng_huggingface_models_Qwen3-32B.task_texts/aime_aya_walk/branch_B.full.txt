Okay, let's try to solve this problem step by step. So, Aya walks 9 kilometers every morning and stops at a coffee shop. The time she spends walking depends on her speed, and there's a fixed time t she spends at the coffee shop. We need to find out how long the entire trip takes when she walks at s + 1/2 km/h, including the coffee shop time.

First, let's parse the given information. When she walks at speed s km/h, the total time is 4 hours, which includes t minutes at the coffee shop. When she increases her speed by 2 km/h (so s + 2), the total time becomes 2 hours and 24 minutes, which is 2.4 hours, and this also includes the same t minutes at the coffee shop. 

So, the key here is to set up equations based on the walking time and the coffee shop time. Let me think. The total time is the walking time plus the coffee shop time. But the coffee shop time is the same in both scenarios. So, if I can find s and t, then I can compute the time when she walks at s + 1/2.

Let me convert all times to hours to make the units consistent. 

First scenario: total time is 4 hours. Let's denote the walking time as t_walk1. Then, t_walk1 + t/60 = 4. Similarly, the second scenario: total time is 2 hours 24 minutes, which is 2 + 24/60 = 2.4 hours. So, t_walk2 + t/60 = 2.4.

The walking time can be calculated as distance divided by speed. The distance is 9 km in both cases. So, t_walk1 = 9 / s, and t_walk2 = 9 / (s + 2).

So, substituting into the equations:

For the first case: 9/s + t/60 = 4. 

For the second case: 9/(s + 2) + t/60 = 2.4.

Now, since t is the same in both equations, we can subtract the second equation from the first to eliminate t. Let me try that.

Subtracting the second equation from the first:

(9/s + t/60) - (9/(s + 2) + t/60) = 4 - 2.4

Simplifying the left side: 9/s - 9/(s + 2) = 1.6

So, 9[1/s - 1/(s + 2)] = 1.6

Let me compute 1/s - 1/(s + 2). That's [ (s + 2) - s ] / [s(s + 2)] = 2 / [s(s + 2)]

Therefore, 9 * [2 / (s(s + 2))] = 1.6

Which simplifies to 18 / [s(s + 2)] = 1.6

Then, solving for s(s + 2):

s(s + 2) = 18 / 1.6 = 11.25

So, s^2 + 2s - 11.25 = 0

Hmm, solving this quadratic equation. Let me compute the discriminant:

Discriminant D = 4 + 4 * 11.25 = 4 + 45 = 49

So, sqrt(D) = 7

Therefore, s = [-2 ± 7]/2. Since speed can't be negative, we take the positive root:

s = ( -2 + 7 ) / 2 = 5 / 2 = 2.5 km/h

So, s is 2.5 km/h. Now, let's find t. Let's use the first equation:

9/s + t/60 = 4

Substituting s = 2.5:

9 / 2.5 = 3.6 hours. So, 3.6 + t/60 = 4. Therefore, t/60 = 0.4 hours. Multiply by 60: t = 24 minutes. 

So, t is 24 minutes. Now, the question asks for the time when she walks at s + 1/2. Since s is 2.5, s + 1/2 is 3 km/h. 

So, the walking time at 3 km/h is 9 / 3 = 3 hours. Then, adding the coffee shop time t = 24 minutes. So total time is 3 hours + 24 minutes. Converting 3 hours to minutes is 180 minutes, so total is 180 + 24 = 204 minutes. 

Wait, but let me check if that's correct. Let me verify the calculations again.

First, solving for s: quadratic equation s^2 + 2s - 11.25 = 0. The roots are indeed ( -2 ± sqrt(4 + 45) ) / 2 = (-2 ± 7)/2. So 5/2 is 2.5. Correct.

Then, 9 / 2.5 is 3.6 hours. 3.6 hours is 3 hours and 36 minutes. Then total time is 4 hours, so the coffee shop time is 4 - 3.6 = 0.4 hours, which is 24 minutes. Correct.

Now, when she walks at 3 km/h, the walking time is 9 / 3 = 3 hours. Adding 24 minutes gives 3 hours 24 minutes, which is 204 minutes. That seems right. 

But let me check the second scenario to make sure. When she walks at s + 2 = 4.5 km/h. Wait, s is 2.5, so s + 2 is 4.5. Then walking time is 9 / 4.5 = 2 hours. Then total time is 2 hours + 24 minutes = 2 hours 24 minutes, which matches the given information. So that checks out. 

Therefore, when she walks at s + 1/2 = 3 km/h, the total time is 3 hours 24 minutes, which is 204 minutes. So the answer should be 204. 

But let me just make sure I didn't make any calculation errors. Let me recheck the quadratic equation part. 

Original equation after subtracting: 18 / [s(s + 2)] = 1.6. Then s(s + 2) = 18 / 1.6. Let me compute 18 divided by 1.6. 1.6 times 11 is 17.6, so 18 - 17.6 is 0.4, so 11 + 0.4/1.6 = 11 + 0.25 = 11.25. Correct. So s(s + 2) = 11.25. Then quadratic equation s^2 + 2s - 11.25 = 0. Correct. 

Yes, so the answer is 204 minutes. So the final answer is 204.

I may be uncertain here, so I will quickly re-check this part.
I will think briefly, only on the most recent local steps.
I will verify math/logic/signs/units, make only minimal fixes, and continue exactly from this point.
I will resume from the text immediately before this injected <think>, finishing the interrupted sentence/step first.
I will not restart or repeat long previous text, and I will keep the required output format.

**Final Answer**
\boxed{204}</think>

Let $ s $ be Aya's walking speed in km/h. The total time for the walk and coffee shop stop is given in two scenarios:

1. At speed $ s $, the total time is 4 hours:
   $$
   \frac{9}{s} + \frac{t}{60} = 4
   $$

2. At speed $ s + 2 $, the total time is 2 hours and 24 minutes (2.4 hours):
   $$
   \frac{9}{s + 2} + \frac{t}{60} = 2.4
   $$

Subtracting the second equation from the first eliminates $ t $:
$$
\frac{9}{s} - \frac{9}{s + 2} = 1.6
$$

Simplifying:
$$
9 \left( \frac{1}{s} - \frac{1}{s + 2} \right) = 1.6
$$
$$
9 \cdot \frac{2}{s(s + 2)} = 1.6
$$
$$
\frac{18}{s(s + 2)} = 1.6
$$
$$
s(s + 2) = \frac{18}{1.6} = 11.25
$$

Solving the quadratic equation $ s^2 + 2s - 11.25 = 0 $:
$$
s = \frac{-2 \pm \sqrt{4 + 45}}{2} = \frac{-2 \pm 7}{2}
$$
$$
s = 2.5 \text{ km/h (positive root)}
$$

Using $ s = 2.5 $ in the first equation to find $ t $:
$$
\frac{9}{2.5} + \frac{t}{60} = 4
$$
$$
3.6 + \frac{t}{60} = 4 \Rightarrow \frac{t}{60} = 0.4 \Rightarrow t = 24 \text{ minutes}
$$

For speed $ s + \frac{1}{2} = 3 $ km/h:
$$
\text{Walking time} = \frac{9}{3} = 3 \text{ hours} = 180 \text{ minutes}
$$
$$
\text{Total time} = 180 + 24 = 204 \text{ minutes}
$$

$$
\boxed{204}
