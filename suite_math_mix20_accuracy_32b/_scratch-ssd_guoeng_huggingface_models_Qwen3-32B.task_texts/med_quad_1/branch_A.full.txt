Okay, let's see. I need to find the value of xy given that x + y = 10 and x² + y² = 58. Hmm, how do I approach this? I remember there's a formula that relates the square of a sum to the sum of squares and the product. Let me recall... Oh right, (x + y)² equals x² + 2xy + y². So if I have x + y, I can square it to get that expression.

Given x + y = 10, squaring both sides gives (x + y)² = 10² = 100. On the other hand, expanding the left side using the formula, it's x² + 2xy + y². But I know that x² + y² is 58. So substituting that in, 58 + 2xy = 100. Then, solving for 2xy, I subtract 58 from both sides: 2xy = 100 - 58 = 42. Therefore, xy = 42 / 2 = 21. Let me check if that makes sense. If xy is 21, then the numbers x and y would be roots of the equation t² - 10t + 21 = 0. Solving that, the roots are [10 ± sqrt(100 - 84)] / 2 = [10 ± sqrt(16)] / 2 = [10 ± 4]/2, which gives 7 and 3. Then 7 + 3 is 10, and 7² + 3² is 49 + 9 = 58. Yep, that matches the given equations. So the answer should be 21.
