Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. The question is asking where Diana believes the contact lens case is after the series of steps provided. I need to track Diana's location, the contact lens case's location, and Diana's belief about it at each step.

Starting with Step 0: Diana and Selena are both in the foyer. The contact lens case is on the foyer's desk, and the chewing gum is on the sunroom's desk. Since Diana is in the foyer and the contact lens case is there, she can see it. So her initial belief should be the foyer's desk.

Step 1: Diana leaves the room. Now her location is None. The contact lens case is still on the foyer's desk. Since she's not in the room, she can't see it, so her belief remains the same as before she left, which was the foyer's desk.

Step 2: Selena moves the contact lens case to the foyer's mantel. Diana is still outside the room, so she doesn't see this action. Her belief doesn't change; she still thinks it's on the desk.

Step 3: Diana enters the foyer. Now she's back in the foyer. The contact lens case is on the mantel. Since she's in the same room, she can see it now. So her belief updates to the mantel.

Step 4: Selena moves the contact lens case back to the foyer's desk. Diana is still in the foyer, so she sees this movement. Her belief now changes to the desk again.

Step 5: Diana leaves the room again. Her location becomes None. The contact lens case is on the desk. Since she's not there, her belief remains the desk, as she last saw it there.

Step 6: Selena moves the case to the mantel again. Diana is not in the room, so she doesn't see this. Her belief stays on the desk.

Step 7: Diana enters the foyer. Now she's back. The case is on the mantel. Since she's in the same room, she can see it, so her belief updates to the mantel.

Step 8: Selena leaves the room. This doesn't affect Diana's belief directly. The case is still on the mantel. Diana is in the foyer, so she still sees it there.

Step 9: Diana moves the contact lens case to the foyer's desk. She's in the foyer, so she does this herself. Her belief now is the desk.

Step 10: Selena enters the sunroom. This doesn't impact Diana's belief. The case is on the desk, and Diana is in the foyer, so she still sees it there.

So, the final step is Step 10. Diana's belief is that the contact lens case is on the foyer's desk.
