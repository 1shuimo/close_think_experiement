Okay, let's see. I need to convert this pseudocode into C++. Let me start by understanding what each line does.

The main function is declared first. Then there are variables x1, x2, y1, y2. Then diff1 and diff2. The code reads two points, calculates the absolute differences in x and y directions. Then compares them and prints the maximum.

Wait, the pseudocode says "if diff1 is greater than diff2, print diff1". Then else if diff2 is greater, print diff2. Then else if they are equal, print diff1. That makes sense because if they are equal, either one is the same.

In C++, to read input, I can use cin. For absolute value, the abs() function from cmath is available. So the steps are straightforward.

Wait, the variables are declared as integers. So when reading input, we need to read x1 and y1 from the first line, then x2 and y2 from the second line. Then compute the absolute differences.

Then compare the two diffs. The code structure would be:

int main() {
    int x1, x2, y1, y2;
    int diff1, diff2;
    cin >> x1 >> y1;
    cin >> x2 >> y2;
    diff1 = abs(x2 - x1);
    diff2 = abs(y2 - y1);
    if (diff1 > diff2) {
        cout << diff1 << endl;
    } else if (diff2 > diff1) {
        cout << diff2 << endl;
    } else {
        cout << diff1 << endl;
    }
    return 0;
}

Wait, the pseudocode uses "else if diff1 = diff2", but in C++ that's an assignment. So the correct condition is using ==. But the pseudocode says "diff1 = diff2" in the else if. But in code, we need to check equality. So the else if would be checking if they are equal. But in C++, the code would be:

if (diff1 > diff2) {
    ...
} else if (diff2 > diff1) {
    ...
} else {
    ...
}

Because if neither is greater, then they must be equal. So the third condition is redundant. But the pseudocode includes it. So in the code, the else block would handle the case where they are equal. So the code is correct.

So the code should look like that. Let me check the pseudocode again. The third condition is "else if diff1 = diff2", which in code would be an assignment, but in the actual code, we can't have that. So the correct code is using else if (diff1 == diff2), but the pseudocode says "else if diff1 = diff2". Wait, maybe the pseudocode uses '=' for assignment and '==' for comparison. But in the code, we need to use '=='.

But in the code, the third condition is actually not needed. Because if the first two conditions are false, then diff1 and diff2 must be equal. So the else block can handle that case. So the code as written in the example I wrote earlier is correct.

So the code should be written with the if-else if-else structure. So the code is correct. I think that's all. Let me write the code accordingly.

```cpp
int main() {
    int x1, x2, y1, y2;
    int diff1, diff2;
    cin >> x1 >> y1;
    cin >> x2 >> y2;
    diff1 = abs(x2 - x1);
    diff2 = abs(y2 - y1);
    if (diff1 > diff2) {
        cout << diff1 << endl;
    } else if (diff2 > diff1) {
        cout << diff2 << endl;
    } else {
        cout << diff1 << endl;
    }
    return 0;
}
```
