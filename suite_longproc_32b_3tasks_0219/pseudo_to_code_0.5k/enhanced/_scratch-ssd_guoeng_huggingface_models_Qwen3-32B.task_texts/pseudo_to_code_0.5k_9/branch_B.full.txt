Okay, let's see. I need to convert this pseudocode into C++. Let me start by understanding what each part does.

The main function starts by reading two strings a and b. Then, it initializes an integer x to 0. There's a loop over each character in the strings. For each index i, it compares a[i] and b[i]. If they are equal, it skips. Otherwise, it checks the value of a[i] and b[i] to adjust x.

Hmm, the pseudocode mentions some specific characters like 8, (, and [. Wait, maybe there's a typo here. Like, maybe '8' is actually a different character? Or perhaps it's a typo for another symbol. Let me check the pseudocode again. Oh, the first condition says if a[i] is equal to 8. But in C++, characters are in quotes. So maybe in the actual code, they meant the character '8'? Or maybe it's a typo for another symbol like '*' or something else. But given the pseudocode as written, I'll assume that the code is checking for the character '8'.

Wait, the pseudocode says "if a[i] is equal to 8". In C++, that would be a[i] == '8'? Because 8 as a character is '8'. So I need to represent that correctly.

Then, for each case, depending on a[i] and b[i], x is adjusted. For example, if a[i] is '8', then if b[i] is '(', decrement x, else increment. Then else if a[i] is '(', check b[i] is '[': subtract 1 (so x -= 1?), else add 1. Then else case: if b[i] is '(', add 1, else decrement.

Wait, the pseudocode uses "add 1 to x" or "subtract 1 from x" or "decrement x" (which is x--?), "increment x" (x++?).

So the logic is:

For each i from 0 to a.size()-1:

if a[i] == b[i]: continue.

Else:

if a[i] is '8':

   if b[i] is '(': x -= 1?

   else: x +=1?

Wait, the pseudocode says:

if a[i] is 8:

   if b[i] is (:

       decrement x (x--)

   else:

       increment x (x++)

Wait, but the pseudocode says for a[i] is 8 and b[i] is (, decrement x. So x--.

But then else (when b[i] is not (), increment x. So x++.

Then else if a[i] is (:

   if b[i] is [:

       subtract 1 from x (x -=1)

   else:

       add 1 to x (x +=1)

Then else (for the a[i] case):

   if b[i] is (:

       add 1 to x (x +=1)

   else:

       decrement x (x--)

Wait, the pseudocode says:

else do the following (which is when a[i] is not 8 or ():

   if b[i] is (:

       add 1 to x

   else:

       decrement x.

So, in code, for each of these conditions, we need to check the characters and adjust x accordingly.

Now, in C++, the code would be:

Read a and b. Probably via cin >> a >> b, assuming they are read as strings.

Then loop for (int i=0; i < a.size(); ++i).

Inside the loop, first check if a[i] == b[i], then continue.

Else, check the conditions.

Now, the code structure would be:

int main() {

    string a, b;

    cin >> a >> b;

    int x = 0;

    for (int i = 0; i < a.size(); ++i) {

        if (a[i] == b[i]) continue;

        if (a[i] == '8') {

            if (b[i] == '(') {

                x--;

            } else {

                x++;

            }

        } else if (a[i] == '(') {

            if (b[i] == '[') {

                x--;

            } else {

                x++;

            }

        } else {

            if (b[i] == '(') {

                x++;

            } else {

                x--;

            }

        }

    }

    if (x == 0) {

        cout << "TIE" << endl;

    } else if (x > 0) {

        cout << "TEAM 1 WINS" << endl;

    } else {

        cout << "TEAM 2 WINS" << endl;

    }

    return 0;

}

Wait, but the pseudocode says in the first condition, if a[i] is equal to 8. So in code, a[i] == '8'? Yes.

But what about the other characters? Like '(', '['. So the code checks for those.

Now, the pseudocode says in the first if condition for a[i] is 8, and then for b[i] is (, else. So that's handled.

Then for a[i] is (, check if b[i] is [. Else add 1 (x++)?

Yes.

In the else case (when a[i] is neither 8 nor ( ), then check if b[i] is (, add 1, else decrement.

So that's the code.

Now, need to make sure that the code is properly structured with the correct conditions and increments.

Also, the code must include the necessary headers, but the user says that the required headers are already included, so we don't need to add them.

So the code is as above. Now, check for possible errors.

What if the strings a and b are of different lengths? The pseudocode says "for i=0 to size of a exclusive". So assuming that a and b are of same length? The pseudocode says that the input is correct. So we don't need to handle that.

So the code should be correct.

Now, write the code in C++ as per the pseudocode.

        if (a[i] == '8') {
            if (b[i] == '(') {
                x--;
            } else {
