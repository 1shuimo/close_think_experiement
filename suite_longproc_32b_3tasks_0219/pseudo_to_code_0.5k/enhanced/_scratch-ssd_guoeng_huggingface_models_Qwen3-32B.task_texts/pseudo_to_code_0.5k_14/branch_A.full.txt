Okay, let's see. I need to convert this pseudocode into C++. Let me go through each part step by step.

First, the main function. The pseudocode starts by defining a 3x3 array called curr, initialized with all 1s. In C++, I can create a 2D vector for that. So maybe vector<vector<int>> curr(3, vector<int>(3, 1)).

Then there's the actions array, also 3x3. The user will input values for each element. So I need to read 3 rows and 3 columns. Using nested loops with i and j from 0 to 3 exclusive. Wait, in C++, loops for 0 to 3 exclusive would be for (int i = 0; i < 3; i++)? Oh right, because 3 is exclusive, so 0,1,2. So for reading actions, I'll have a 2D vector actions(3, vector<int>(3)), then loop and read each element with cin.

Then the main processing loops. For each i and j, if actions[i][j] is odd, perform some operations. So in C++, check if actions[i][j] % 2 != 0. Then, if curr[i][j] is 1, set to 0, else 1. That's like toggling, but written as if-else. Then check the neighboring cells: left (j-1), up (i-1), right (j+1), down (i+1). For each direction, if the index is valid, toggle their values.

Wait, the pseudocode uses assignments like curr[i][j] = 1 or 0. So for each of those conditions, we have to flip the current cell and its neighbors. But note that when checking the neighbors, we have to make sure they are within the 3x3 grid. The pseudocode checks if j>0 before accessing j-1, etc. So that's handled in the conditions.

Then after processing all actions, print the curr matrix. Each row is printed with elements separated, and then a new line. So for each row, loop through the elements and print them, maybe using cout << curr[i][j] << " "; then a newline after each row.

Now, translating all that into C++ code. Let me outline the steps:

1. Initialize curr as 3x3 with 1s.
2. Read the actions matrix.
3. Process each cell in actions:
   For each i, j in 0-2:
      if actions[i][j] is odd:
         toggle curr[i][j]
         check left (j-1 >=0?), toggle
         check up (i-1 >=0?), toggle
         check right (j+1 <3?), toggle
         check down (i+1 <3?), toggle
But wait, the pseudocode's code for the neighbors is written as if they check the conditions and then toggle. So for example, if j>0, then check curr[i][j-1] and flip it.

But in C++, the code would be:

if (j > 0) {
   curr[i][j-1] = (curr[i][j-1] == 1 ? 0 : 1);
}

But maybe there's a better way, like curr[i][j-1] ^= 1. Because 1 becomes 0, 0 becomes 1. Since XOR with 1 toggles the bit.

Same for the other cells. So perhaps in code, after checking the boundaries, we can just toggle those cells.

So for each direction, if the index is valid, we toggle the value.

So for the current cell, if actions[i][j] is odd, then:

curr[i][j] ^= 1;

Then for left, up, right, down, check the index and toggle.

Now, the code structure.

In the main function:

vector<vector<int>> curr(3, vector<int>(3, 1));
vector<vector<int>> actions(3, vector<int>(3));

Read the actions:

for (int i = 0; i < 3; ++i) {
    for (int j = 0; j < 3; ++j) {
        cin >> actions[i][j];
    }
}

Then process each cell:

for (int i = 0; i < 3; ++i) {
    for (int j = 0; j < 3; ++j) {
        if (actions[i][j] % 2 == 1) {
            // Toggle current cell
            curr[i][j] ^= 1;
            // Left
            if (j > 0) {
                curr[i][j-1] ^= 1;
            }
            // Up
            if (i > 0) {
                curr[i-1][j] ^= 1;
            }
            // Right
            if (j < 2) {
                curr[i][j+1] ^= 1;
            }
            // Down
            if (i < 2) {
                curr[i+1][j] ^= 1;
            }
        }
    }
}

Wait, the pseudocode for the current cell uses if-else to set to 0 or 1. But since actions[i][j] is odd, and we check that, then curr[i][j] is toggled. Using XOR is equivalent. So that's correct.

Then for each neighbor, the code checks if the index is valid (like j>0) and then toggles. Which is exactly what the pseudocode does. So this should be correct.

Then, print the curr matrix:

for (int i = 0; i < 3; ++i) {
    for (int j = 0; j < 3; ++j) {
        cout << curr[i][j] << " ";
    }
    cout << endl;
}

Wait, but in the pseudocode's print part, it says "for i from 0 to 3 exclusive, for j=0 to 3 exclusive, print curr[i][j], print new line". So each row is printed with all elements, then a new line. So the inner loop prints each element with a space, and after the inner loop, a new line.

But in the code above, each element is followed by a space, and then a new line. However, the original curr is initialized with all 1s, and after processing, perhaps some 0s and 1s.

But the code as written would print each element with a space, but the problem says to print the curr[i][j]. The pseudocode's print is not specified to have spaces, but in practice, when printing a 2D array, adding spaces between elements is standard. For example, if the first row is 1 0 1, then the code would print that. So the code as written is correct.

Finally, return 0; to indicate successful execution.

Putting it all together in the main function.

Now, check for possible errors. For example, when j is 0, j-1 is -1, but the code checks j>0 before accessing. Same for other directions. So the code is safe.

Another thing: the pseudocode uses = for assignment (like curr[i][j] = 1), but in C++, we use =. The check for equality is ==, but in the pseudocode's if conditions, like if curr[i][j] = 1, which would be assignment in C++. But in the actual code, we are using ^= 1 for toggling, which is equivalent to the if-else block. So the code is correct.

Yes, because the pseudocode's if (curr[i][j] = 1) would be a mistake (assignment instead of comparison), but in the actual logic, the code is supposed to flip the value. However, in the pseudocode, it's written as if they are checking the current value and then setting the opposite. But the net effect is toggling. So using ^=1 is correct.

Therefore, the code should work as intended.
