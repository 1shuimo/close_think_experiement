Okay, let's see. I need to convert this pseudocode into C++. Let me go through each line step by step.

First, the main function. So, in C++, that's int main(). Then inside, we have to declare an integer count initialized to 0. And an integer array arr of size 4. Wait, the pseudocode says "array arr with size 4", so in C++ that would be int arr[4];.

Next, there's a loop from i=0 to 4 exclusive. Since it's exclusive, it's i from 0 to 3 (since 4 elements, indexes 0-3). So a for loop: for (int i=0; i<4; i++) { cin >> arr[i]; }.

Then another loop: for i=0 to 3 exclusive. So again, i from 0 to 3 (since 3 is exclusive, up to 2, so i < 3). So for (int i=0; i < 3; i++).

Inside that loop, if arr[i] is not zero. Then for j from i+1 to 4 exclusive. So j starts at i+1 and goes up to 3 (since 4 is exclusive). So for (int j = i+1; j < 4; j++).

Inside that, check if arr[i] equals arr[j] and arr[j] is not zero. If so, increment count and set arr[j] to 0. So count++ and arr[j] = 0.

After all that, print count followed by a newline. So cout << count << endl;.

Return 0 at the end.

Wait, but in C++, the main function returns an integer. So the return statement is return 0; to indicate success.

Now, putting it all together. Let me check the loops again. The first loop reads 4 elements. Then the nested loops: for i from 0 to 3 (exclusive of 3?), wait the pseudocode says "for i = 0 to 3 exclusive". So 0 to 3 exclusive would be i < 3. So i runs 0, 1, 2. Then for each i, j runs from i+1 to 4 exclusive (so up to 3, indexes 0-3). So j will go from i+1 to 3.

So the code structure would be:

int main() {
    int count = 0;
    int arr[4];
    for (int i=0; i<4; i++) {
        cin >> arr[i];
    }
    for (int i=0; i < 3; i++) {
        if (arr[i] != 0) {
            for (int j = i+1; j < 4; j++) {
                if (arr[i] == arr[j] && arr[j] != 0) {
                    count++;
                    arr[j] = 0;
                }
            }
        }
    }
    cout << count << endl;
    return 0;
}

Wait, but the pseudocode says "for i = 0 to 3 exclusive". So the upper limit for i is 3, but exclusive. So i runs from 0 to 2. So the loop is correct as i < 3.

Testing with sample input. Let's say input is 1 1 1 1. Then for i=0, arr[0] is 1. Check j=1,2,3. j=1: same, count becomes 1, set to 0. j=2: arr[2] is 1 (since it's not set yet). So count becomes 2, set to 0. j=3: same, count 3, set to 0. Then i=1: arr[1] is 0 now, so skip. i=2: arr[2] is 0, skip. So total count is 3. Which would be correct. So the code seems to handle that.

Another example: input 1 2 3 4. Then no duplicates, count is 0.

Another case: 2 2 0 2. Let's see. Initial array is [2,2,0,2]. For i=0 (value 2). Check j=1: value 2. So count becomes 1, set to 0. j=2: 0, skip. j=3: 2, so count becomes 2, set to 0. Then i=1: arr[1] is 0, skip. i=2: j starts at 3, but arr[3] is 0. So total count is 2. That seems right.

Yes, I think this code should work.

```cpp
int main() {
    int count = 1;
    int arr[5];
    for (int i = 0; i < 4; i++) {
        std::cin >> arr[i];
    }
    for (int i = 0; i < 3; i++) {
        if (arr[i] != 0) {
            for (int j = i + 1; j < 4; j++) {
                if (arr[i] == arr[j] && arr[j] != 0) {
                    count++;
                    arr[j] = 0;
                }
            }
        }
    }
    std::cout << count << std::endl;
    return 0;
}
```<think>
I am not fully confident. Re-check and decide again. The code seems to have a typo in the initial count value. The pseudocode says count starts at 0. The code here shows count = 1. That's incorrect. Fix it to count = 0. Also, the array size is 4, but the code shows arr[5]. That's wrong. The pseudocode says array size 4, so arr[4]. The rest of the loops are correct. Correct these two errors.

```cpp
int main() {
    int count = 0;
    int arr[4];
    for (int i = 0; i < 4; i++) {
        std::cin >> arr[i];
    }
    for (int i = 0; i < 3; i++) {
        if (arr[i] != 0) {
            for (int j = i + 1; j < 4; j++) {
                if (arr[i] == arr[j] && arr[j] != 0) {
                    count++;
                    arr[j] = 0;
                }
            }
        }
    }
    std::cout << count << std::endl;
    return 0;
}
