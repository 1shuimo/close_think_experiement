Okay, let's see. I need to convert the given pseudocode into C++. Let me go step by step.

First, the main function is defined. So I'll start with int main(). Then, inside main, we declare an integer n and an array a with 1010 elements. Wait, in C++, arrays have fixed sizes, but maybe they mean a vector here? But the pseudocode says "array a with 1010 elements". Oh, maybe it's a static array. So perhaps int a[1010];. But sometimes in programming contests, people use vectors, but the pseudocode might be using a fixed array. Let's go with that.

Next, read n from input. So cin >> n;. Then read n sequential elements of a. So for (int i=0; i<n; i++) cin >> a[i];. Then sort a. The sort function in C++ is sort(a, a + n) if it's an array. But wait, if the array is of size 1010, but we only read n elements. So when we sort, we need to sort the first n elements. So the code for that is sort(a, a + n);.

Then the condition: if a[0] - 1 <= 0, print -1 else print 1. Wait, a[0] -1 <=0 is equivalent to a[0] <=1. So if the first element after sorting is less than or equal to 1, output -1, else 1. So the code would be if (a[0] - 1 <= 0) cout << -1 << endl; else cout << 1 << endl;. But wait, maybe the pseudocode is trying to check if 1 is missing? Like, if the smallest element is greater than 1, then output 1. Otherwise, output -1. For example, if the array has elements starting from 1 or lower, then there's no 1 in the array. Wait, no. If a[0] is the smallest element. If a[0] -1 <=0 means a[0] <=1. So if the smallest element is <=1, then output -1. Otherwise, 1. So for example, if the array has all elements greater than 1, then the answer is 1. Otherwise, -1. That makes sense.

But wait, what if the array is empty? But according to the problem, n is read from input, but the pseudocode says to read n elements. So assuming n is at least 1? Well, the code should handle that. But according to the pseudocode, maybe n is given correctly. Let's proceed.

Now, putting it all together. Let me check the code:

int main() {
    int n;
    int a[1010];
    cin >> n;
    for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
        cin >> a[i];
    }
    sort(a, a + n);
    if (a[0] - 1 <= 0) {
        cout << -1 << endl;
    } else {
        cout << 1 << endl;
    }
    return 0;
}

Wait, but what if n is zero? But the problem says that the pseudocode is correct and complete, so maybe n is at least 1. But in practice, if n is zero, accessing a[0] would be undefined. However, since the pseudocode says to read n elements, perhaps n is given as a valid number. So the code is okay.

Another thing: in C++, the array a is declared with 1010 elements. So if n exceeds 1010, this code would have a problem. But the pseudocode says that the array has 1010 elements, so perhaps n is guaranteed to be within that. So the code is okay.

So this should correspond to the pseudocode. Let me check each line again.

Yes, the code seems to follow the pseudocode line by line. So this should be the correct C++ code.

```cpp
int main() {
    int n;
    int a[1011];
    cin >> n;
    for (int i = 1; i < n; ++i) {
        cin >> a[i];
    }
    sort(a, a + n);
    if (a[0] - 1 <= 0) {
        cout << -1 << endl;
    } else {
        cout << 1 << endl;
    }
    return 0;
}
```<think>
I am not fully confident. Re-check and decide again. The code has a[1011] but the pseudocode says 1010 elements. Also, the loop for reading elements starts at i=1 but the pseudocode says to read n sequential elements. The loop should start at i=0. The code is incorrect. The correct code should have a[1010] and the loop should run from i=0 to i < n. The current code has a[1011] and starts at i=1, which is wrong. Need to fix the array size and loop indices. The correct code should be:

int main() {
    int n;
    int a[1010];
    cin >> n;
    for (int i = 0; i < n; ++i) {
        cin >> a[i];
    }
    sort(a, a + n);
    if (a[0] - 1 <= 0) {
        cout << -1 << endl;
    } else {
        cout << 1 << endl;
    }
    return 0;
}

```cpp
int main() {
    int n;
    int a[1010];
    cin >> n;
    for (int i = 0; i < n; ++i) {
        cin >> a[i];
    }
    sort(a, a + n);
    if (a[0] - 1 <= 0) {
        cout << -1 << endl;
    } else {
        cout << 1 << endl;
    }
    return 0;
}
