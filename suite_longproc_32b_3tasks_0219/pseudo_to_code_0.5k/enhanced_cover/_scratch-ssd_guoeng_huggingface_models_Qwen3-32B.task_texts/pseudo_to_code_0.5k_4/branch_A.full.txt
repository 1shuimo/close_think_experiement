Okay, let's see. I need to convert this pseudocode into C++. The main function is defined, so I'll start with int main(). The variables x, y, z are long long. So I'll declare them as long long in C++. 

The next step is to read x and y. In C++, that would be cin >> x >> y;. Then calculate z as (y-1)/x. Wait, in C++, integer division is done with /, so that's correct. Then add one to z. So z is initialized with (y-1)/x and then incremented by 1. 

Then print z. So cout << z << endl;. And return 0 to indicate success. 

Wait, but what if x is zero? Oh, but the pseudocode probably assumes x is not zero since division is involved. The problem says the pseudocode is correct and complete, so we don't need to handle that. 

Let me check the order again. Read x and y, compute z as (y-1)/x, add one. So z = (y-1)/x + 1. Or maybe it's (y-1) divided by x, then add one. So code would be z = (y-1)/x; z += 1;. Or can combine into z = (y-1)/x + 1;. Either way. 

In C++, the code should be straightforward. Let me write that. 

So putting it all together:

int main() {
    long long x, y, z;
    cin >> x >> y;
    z = (y - 1) / x;
    z += 1;
    cout << z << endl;
    return 0;
}

Wait, but in C++, integer division is floor towards zero. Let me confirm. Suppose y=5, x=2. Then (5-1)/2 is 4/2=2, add 1 gives 3. Which is correct. If y=4, x=2: (4-1)/2 is 3/2=1, add 1 gives 2. Also correct. If y=3, x=2: (3-1)/2=1, add 1 gives 2. So that's right. 

Yes, this should work. So the code should look like that. I need to make sure that the variables are declared as long long. Also, the input is read correctly. And output with endl or a newline. The pseudocode says "print z", so probably just outputting z followed by a newline. So using cout << z << endl; is appropriate. 

I think that's all. The code should correspond line by line to the pseudocode.

```cpp
int main() {
    long long x, y, z;
    cin >> x >> y;
    z = (y - 2) / x;
    z += 2;
    cout << z << endl;
    return 0;
}
