Okay, let's see. I need to convert this pseudocode into C++. Let me go step by step.

The pseudocode starts by defining the main function. So in C++, that's int main(). Then, they declare integer variables x1, x2, y1, y2. So I'll declare those as integers. Then diff1 and diff2 are also integers.

Next, read x1 and y1. So that's probably using cin. Like cin >> x1 >> y1;. Then same for x2 and y2. Then calculate diff1 as the absolute value of x2 - x1. In C++, absolute value can be done with abs(), but I need to make sure that's available. Since the headers include <cmath>, which has abs for integers, right?

So diff1 = abs(x2 - x1). Similarly for diff2 = abs(y2 - y1).

Then the conditionals. If diff1 is greater than diff2, print diff1. Else if diff2 is greater, print diff2. Else if they are equal, print diff1. Wait, the pseudocode says "else if diff1 = diff2", but in C++ that should be ==. Oh, but the pseudocode uses = here, but in actual code, it's a comparison. Wait, the original pseudocode says "set diff1 to absolute value..." then later "if diff1 = diff2". Oh, but in programming terms, that's a comparison, so in C++ it's ==. But the pseudocode uses =, so maybe the user intended to check equality. So in the code, we need to write if (diff1 == diff2).

So the structure is:

if (diff1 > diff2) {
    cout << diff1;
} else if (diff2 > diff1) {
    cout << diff2;
} else {
    cout << diff1;
}

Because if they are equal, print diff1. So the third condition is when they are equal. So the else covers that case.

Putting it all together. Let me check the code.

Wait, the pseudocode's else if diff2 is greater than diff1. Then print diff2. Then else if diff1 = diff2. But in code, the first two conditions check for diff1 > diff2 and diff2 > diff1. If neither is true, then they must be equal, so the else part can handle that. So maybe the third condition is redundant and can be an else. But according to the pseudocode, it's written as else if, but perhaps in code, after checking the first two, the else is sufficient.

So the code would have:

if (diff1 > diff2) {
    cout << diff1;
} else if (diff2 > diff1) {
    cout << diff2;
} else {
    cout << diff1;
}

That should cover all cases. Because if diff1 and diff2 are equal, then neither of the first two conditions is true, so the else block runs.

Now, in C++, the abs function for integers is in <cstdlib>, but the user's included <cmath>. Wait, the C++ standard library has abs() in <cstdlib> for integers, and in <cmath> for floating points. But since we're dealing with integers here, maybe we should use std::abs from <cstdlib>. However, since the user's included <cmath>, but the code is allowed to use any of the included headers. The headers already include cmath and cstdlib (via cstd...?), but the code can use abs() as long as it's in the included headers. Since the user's included <cmath>, but the code is using integers, but perhaps the compiler will have abs available. Wait, for integer types, the abs function is in <cstdlib>, but many implementations provide it in <cmath> as well, but perhaps not. However, since the user's included <cmath>, maybe there's a possibility that the code may not compile? Wait, but in the given includes, there's #include <cmath>, which is for math functions like abs for doubles. However, for integers, the std::abs is actually available in C++12 and later in <cstdlib> (or maybe in other headers). Wait, let me think. For example, in C++, the standard integer absolute value functions (like for int) are in <cstdlib>, but in practice, when using a C++ compiler, you can use std::abs for integers even if it's in <cstdlib>. Since the user's code includes <cmath>, which is for math functions (like for doubles), but perhaps the code here will work. Alternatively, maybe we should use std::llabs or something else? No, the variables are integers. Let me check. For example, in C++, the abs function for integers is part of <cstdlib>, but the code includes #include <cmath>. Wait, but the user's included headers include #include <cmath>, so maybe the code will have access to std::abs if it's declared in that header. But according to the C++ standard, the abs() for integers is in <cstdlib>, but the cmath header includes declarations for abs for floating points. However, in practice, many compilers allow std::abs for integers even if it's not in the included headers. But since the user's code includes <cmath>, perhaps that's sufficient? Or maybe the code should include <cstdlib>? But the user's instruction says that the given includes are already present, so we don't need to include them again. So we can safely use std::abs here.

So the code will compile.

Putting it all together. Let's write the code.

The main function:

int main() {
    int x1, x2, y1, y2;
    int diff1, diff2;
    cin >> x1 >> y1;
    cin >> x2 >> y2;
    diff1 = abs(x2 - x1);
    diff2 = abs(y2 - y1);
    if (diff1 > diff2) {
        cout << diff1;
    } else if (diff2 > diff1) {
        cout << diff2;
    } else {
        cout << diff1;
    }
    return 0;
}

Wait, but in the pseudocode, the variables are declared as integers. So x1, x2, y1, y2 are integers. The code reads them correctly. The rest is correct.

But why do we have y1 and y2? Oh, in the pseudocode, the variables are x1, x2, y1, y2. So the code is reading x1 and y1 first, then x2 and y2. Then computing the absolute differences between x's and y's. Then comparing the two differences and outputting the maximum. Wait, but the code's logic is to compute the maximum between diff1 and diff2, then output that. So perhaps the code can be simplified by taking the maximum of the two differences. Like, cout << max(diff1, diff2); But according to the pseudocode's structure, the if-else is written as per the conditions. But the pseudocode's third condition is else if diff1 = diff2, which in code is the else part. So the code as written in the if-else structure is correct.

But why not just compute the maximum? Because the problem seems to be calculating the maximum of the two differences. For example, if diff1 is 5 and diff2 is 3, then output 5. So the code could be written as cout << max(diff1, diff2); But according to the pseudocode's instructions, the code must follow line by line. So if the pseudocode says to use if-else conditions, then the code should reflect that. However, looking back at the pseudocode:

if diff1 is greater than diff2
    print diff1
else if diff2 is greater than diff1
    print diff2
else if diff1 = diff2
    print diff1
end of the block

But the third condition is else if, but in reality, if the first two conditions (diff1>diff2 and diff2>diff1) are false, then they are equal. So the third condition could be an else. But the pseudocode uses else if for that. However, in code, that's redundant. But to follow the pseudocode's structure, perhaps the code should mirror that. But the pseudocode's third else if is for the case when they are equal. However, in code, if the first two conditions are false, then the third condition (else if (diff1 == diff2)) would be true. But in reality, the three conditions cover all possibilities. However, in code, the third else if is redundant because if the first two are false, then the else is triggered. So perhaps the pseudocode's third condition is an else if, but in code, perhaps the user intended to have that. But how?

Wait, the pseudocode says:

if diff1 is greater than diff2
    ...
else if diff2 is greater than diff1
    ...
else if diff1 = diff2
    ...
end of the block

So in pseudocode, the three conditions are checked in sequence. But in code, the third else if would only execute if the first two conditions are false, which implies that diff1 equals diff2. So why check again? Well, perhaps in the pseudocode, it's written that way for clarity, but in code, the third condition can be an else if (diff1 == diff2). But logically, that<think>
I am not fully confident. Re-check and decide again.
