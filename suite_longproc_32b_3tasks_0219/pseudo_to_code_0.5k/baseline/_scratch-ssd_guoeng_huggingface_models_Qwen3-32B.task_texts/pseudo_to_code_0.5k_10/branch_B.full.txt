Okay, let's see. I need to convert the given pseudocode into C++. Let me go through each line step by step.

The pseudocode says to define the main function. So in C++, that's int main(). Then, create strings n1 and n2. So I'll have to declare two string variables. Then read them. So cin >> n1 >> n2, maybe? But wait, in C++, strings can be read using cin, but if there are spaces, but the problem probably assumes that each input is a single line. So maybe that's okay.

Next, there's a loop from i=0 to the length of n1 exclusive. So for (int i=0; i < n1.length(); i++). Inside the loop, if n1[i] equals n2[i], set n1[i] to '0'. Otherwise, set it to '1'. So for each character in the strings, compare them. Then, after processing all characters, print n1. Then return 0.

Wait, but in C++, strings are mutable, so modifying individual characters is allowed. So the loop will iterate over each index. But need to make sure that n1 and n2 are of the same length? The pseudocode seems to assume that, but in practice, maybe the code should handle cases where they are different lengths? However, the problem says the pseudocode is correct and complete, so we can assume that n1 and n2 have the same length.

So code steps:

In main function:

string n1, n2;
cin >> n1 >> n2;

Then loop through each index. For each i from 0 to n1.length() - 1 (exclusive). Wait, the pseudocode says "for i from 0 to length of n1 exclusive", which is 0 <= i < length, so the loop is correct.

Inside the loop:

if (n1[i] == n2[i]) {
    n1[i] = '0';
} else {
    n1[i] = '1';
}

After processing all, print n1. So cout << n1 << endl;

Return 0.

So putting it all together:

#include statements are already provided, so not needed.

Wait, the user instruction says that the code should correspond to the pseudocode line by line. So the code should be written exactly as per the pseudocode steps.

Now, in C++, the code would be:

int main() {
    string n1, n2;
    cin >> n1 >> n2;
    for (int i = 0; i < n1.length(); i++) {
        if (n1[i] == n2[i]) {
            n1[i] = '0';
        } else {
            n1[i] = '1';
        }
    }
    cout << n1 << endl;
    return 0;
}

Wait, but in some cases, maybe the input has leading or trailing whitespaces? But the pseudocode says "read n1 and n2", so using cin >> would read until whitespace. But if the problem expects to read entire lines, maybe using getline. However, since the pseudocode says to read n1 and n2, and in programming competition settings, usually cin >> is acceptable for reading strings, assuming that they are separated by whitespace. But if the strings can contain spaces, then that approach would not work. However, given that the pseudocode uses a simple read, perhaps it's intended that each string is read as a single line. So maybe we should use getline.

Wait, but in the given pseudocode, when they say "read n1 and n2", perhaps it's similar to cin >> n1 >> n2. For example, if the input is two words on the same line, or two lines. But the code as written would work for both cases. Or perhaps the problem expects that n1 and n2 are read as separate inputs. For example, in programming competition problems, it's common to read from standard input with cin. So perhaps the code is correct.

Another thing: in C++, the length of the string can be obtained with .length() or .size(). Both work. The pseudocode uses "length of n1", so using n1.length() is correct.

So the code seems correct. Let me test with sample input.

Sample input 1:

12345
12345

Then for each character, they are same, so n1 becomes 00000. Output is 00000.

Sample input 2:

abc
abd

Compare each character:

a vs a: same → 0.

b vs b: same → 0.

c vs d: different → 1. So output is 001.

Yes. So code should work.

Now, code as per the user's instruction. The user says to output only the C++ code block wrapped with ```cpp and ```. So the code should be enclosed in those markers. Also, the code must not include the #includes again. The user says that the libraries are already included.

So the code is as written above. Also, the using namespace std is already present, so we can use string, cout, etc. directly.

So the code is correct.

```cpp
int main() {
    string n1, n2;
    cin >> n1 >> n2;
    for (int i = 0; i < n1.length(); i++) {
        if (n1[i] == n2[i]) {
            n1[i] = '0';
        } else {
            n1[i] = '1';
        }
    }
    cout << n1 << endl;
    return 0;
}

I am not fully confident. Re-check and decide again.
