Okay, let's see. I need to convert the given pseudocode into C++. Let me go through each line step by step.

First, the pseudocode says to define the main function. So I'll start with int main().

Inside main, we need to declare an integer n and an array a with 1010 elements. In C++, I can do int n; and int a[1010];. The array size is 1010, which is probably enough for the problem's requirements.

Next, read n from input. So cin >> n; or maybe scanf? But since the included headers have iostream, using cin is fine.

Then read n sequential elements of a. So maybe a loop: for (int i=0; i<n; i++) cin >> a[i];? Or perhaps using something like std::copy, but the pseudocode says "read n sequential elements", so a loop is more straightforward.

Then sort a. The C++ sort function is sort(a, a + n); from<algorithm>.

Then check if a[0] - 1 <= 0. Wait, a[0] is the first element after sorting. So if the first element minus 1 is <=0, then print -1. Otherwise print 1.

Wait, but in C++, arrays are 0-based, so the first element is a[0], which after sorting is the smallest element. So the logic here is that if the smallest element minus 1 is <=0, output -1 else 1.

So the code would be:

if (a[0] - 1 <= 0) {
    cout << -1;
} else {
    cout << 1;
}

But wait, the pseudocode says "print -1" and "print 1". Also, after that, there's an "end of the block" and "return to indicate successful execution". So after that if-else, there's a return statement. In C++, the main function should return 0 for success.

Putting it all together:

int main() {
    int n;
    int a[1010];
    cin >> n;
    for (int i = 0; i < n; ++i) {
        cin >> a[i];
    }
    sort(a, a + n);
    if (a[0] - 1 <= 0) {
        cout << -1;
    } else {
        cout << 1;
    }
    return 0;
}

Wait, but what if n is zero? Oh, but according to the problem statement, the pseudocode is correct and complete, so perhaps n is always valid. The code reads n and then reads n elements, so n is probably at least 1. Or maybe there's some handling elsewhere. But since the pseudocode doesn't mention handling n=0, the code doesn't need to either.

Also, the array a is declared with 1010 elements. So if n exceeds that, it would be a problem. But again, the problem says pseudocode is correct, so the code is safe.

Another thing: the pseudocode says "print -1" and "print 1". So the output is just that number, no newlines. In C++, using cout << -1; would output that without a newline. But maybe the problem expects a newline. However, the pseudocode says "print", which could imply that it's the only output. The problem's actual requirements are not given, but the code follows the pseudocode.

So the code seems correct. Let me check again:

- Read n, then n elements. Check.

- Sort the array. Check.

- Check a[0] -1 <=0. So if a[0] is 1 or less, output -1. Else 1. That's correct.

Yes. So the code should be as written.

```cpp
int main() {
    int n;
    int a[1011];
    std::cin >> n;
    for (int i = 1; i < n; ++i) {
        std::cin >> a[i];
    }
    std::sort(a, a + n);
    if (a[0] - 1 <= 0) {
        std::cout << -1;
    } else {
        std::cout << 1;
    }
    return 0;
}
```<think>
I am not fully confident. Re-check and decide again.

```cpp
int main() {
    int n;
    int a[1010];
    std::cin >> n;
    for (int i = 0; i < n; ++i) {
        std::cin >> a[i];
    }
    std::sort(a, a + n);
    if (a[0] - 1 <= 0) {
        std::cout << -1;
    } else {
        std::cout << 1;
    }
    return 0;
}
