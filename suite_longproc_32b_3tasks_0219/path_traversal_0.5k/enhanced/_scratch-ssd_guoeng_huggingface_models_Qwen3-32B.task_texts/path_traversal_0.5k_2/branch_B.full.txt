Okay, let's see. I need to find the route from Sassari to Oberhausen. Let me start by looking at the connections step by step.

First, Sassari is connected to Brest by plane. So the first step is from Sassari to Brest. Then, Brest is connected to Ryazan by ferry. Next, Ryazan goes to Caterham by bus. Caterham is connected to Chita by bus. Chita then goes to Chelmsford by ferry. Chelmsford is connected to Norwich by ferry. Norwich goes to Bakersfield by ferry. Bakersfield is connected to Porto by bus. Porto goes to Horley by ferry. Horley is connected to Las Vegas by ferry. Las Vegas goes to Bonn by bus. Bonn is connected to Udine by bus. Udine goes to Basildon by plane. Basildon is connected to Kirov by train. Kirov goes to Margate by bus. Margate is connected to Lisbon by train. Lisbon goes to Scunthorpe by plane. Scunthorpe is connected to Olomouc by plane. Olomouc goes to Oceanside by ferry. Oceanside is connected to Hagen by plane. Hagen goes to Tampa by ferry. Tampa is connected to Augsburg by ferry. Finally, Augsburg goes to Sofia by bus, and Sofia goes to Oberhausen by bus. 

Wait, let me check each step again to make sure I didn't skip anything. Starting from Sassari to Brest, then Brest to Ryazan, Ryazan to Caterham, Caterham to Chita, Chita to Chelmsford, Chelmsford to Norwich, Norwich to Bakersfield, Bakersfield to Porto, Porto to Horley, Horley to Las Vegas, Las Vegas to Bonn, Bonn to Udine, Udine to Basildon, Basildon to Kirov, Kirov to Margate, Margate to Lisbon, Lisbon to Scunthorpe, Scunthorpe to Olomouc, Olomouc to Oceanside, Oceanside to Hagen, Hagen to Tampa, Tampa to Augsburg, Augsburg to Sofia, and Sofia to Oberhausen. That seems to cover all the steps without any loops or missing connections. Each city leads to the next one as per the given data. So the final route should be all these steps in order.
