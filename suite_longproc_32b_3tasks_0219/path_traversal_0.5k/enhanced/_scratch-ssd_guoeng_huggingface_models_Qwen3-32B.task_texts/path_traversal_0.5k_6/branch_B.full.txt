Okay, let's see. I need to find the route from Limoges to Fremont. Let me start by looking at the connections for each city step by step.

First, Limoges is connected to Bexley by ferry. So the first step is from Limoges to Bexley via ferry. Then, Bexley goes to Rimini by ferry. Next, Rimini is connected to Brackley by ferry. Brackley then goes to Burnley by bus. Burnley connects to Potsdam by bus. Potsdam to Krakow by train. Krakow to Kaluga by plane. Kaluga to Billericay by bus. Billericay to Nizhny Novgorod by plane. Nizhny Novgorod to Ilkeston by train. Ilkeston to Bellevue by bus. Bellevue to Hayward by bus. Hayward to Odessa by train. Odessa to Plymouth by train. Plymouth to Lakewood by plane. Lakewood to Pembroke Pines by plane. Pembroke Pines to Thornton by train. Thornton to Gloucester by bus. Gloucester to Tirana by ferry. Tirana to Sterling Heights by plane. Sterling Heights to Cedar Rapids by train. Cedar Rapids to Brest by bus. Brest to Bromley by bus. Bromley to Oceanside by plane. Oceanside to Sidcup by plane. Sidcup to Kemerovo by ferry. Kemerovo to Penrith by plane. Penrith to Banja Luka by ferry. Banja Luka to Thatcham by train. Thatcham to Leverkusen by plane. Leverkusen to Baltimore by ferry. Baltimore to Tolyatti by plane. Tolyatti to Chemnitz by train. Chemnitz to Columbia by train. Columbia to Lisbon by ferry. Lisbon to Bath by bus. Bath to Reykjavik by train. Reykjavik to Bakersfield by train. Bakersfield to Fremont by train. 

Wait, that's a lot of steps. Let me check each connection again to make sure I didn't skip any. Starting from Limoges:

1. Limoges → Bexley (ferry)
2. Bexley → Rimini (ferry)
3. Rimini → Brackley (ferry)
4. Brackley → Burnley (bus)
5. Burnley → Potsdam (bus)
6. Potsdam → Krakow (train)
7. Krakow → Kaluga (plane)
8. Kaluga → Billericay (bus)
9. Billericay → Nizhny Novgorod (plane)
10. Nizhny Novgorod → Ilkeston (train)
11. Ilkeston → Bellevue (bus)
12. Bellevue → Hayward (bus)
13. Hayward → Odessa (train)
14. Odessa → Plymouth (train)
15. Plymouth → Lakewood (plane)
16. Lakewood → Pembroke Pines (plane)
17. Pembroke Pines → Thornton (train)
18. Thornton → Gloucester (bus)
19. Gloucester → Tirana (ferry)
20. Tirana → Sterling Heights (plane)
21. Sterling Heights → Cedar Rapids (train)
22. Cedar Rapids → Brest (bus)
23. Brest → Bromley (bus)
24. Bromley → Oceanside (plane)
25. Oceanside → Sidcup (plane)
26. Sidcup → Kemerovo (ferry)
27. Kemerovo → Penrith (plane)
28. Penrith → Banja Luka (ferry)
29. Banja Luka → Thatcham (train)
30. Thatcham → Leverkusen (plane)
31. Leverkusen → Baltimore (ferry)
32. Baltimore → Tolyatti (plane)
33. Tolyatti → Chemnitz (train)
34. Chemnitz → Columbia (train)
35. Columbia → Lisbon (ferry)
36. Lisbon → Bath (bus)
37. Bath → Reykjavik (train)
38. Reykjavik → Bakersfield (train)
39. Bakersfield → Fremont (train)

Yes, that seems to cover all the steps from Limoges to Fremont. Each step follows the one-way connections as given. I need to make sure there are no loops or missed connections. Let me verify a few key points. For example, after Bakersfield, the next is Fremont via train, which is correct. All transitions are valid based on the provided data. So the route is correct.

I am not fully confident. Re-check and decide again. The route from Limoges to Fremont requires following all one-way connections step by step. Each city connects to only one other city, so the path is deterministic. I will verify the sequence again to ensure no steps are missed or misordered. The final step should reach Fremont via Bakersfield. The route seems correct as each transition is valid. I will proceed with the output.
