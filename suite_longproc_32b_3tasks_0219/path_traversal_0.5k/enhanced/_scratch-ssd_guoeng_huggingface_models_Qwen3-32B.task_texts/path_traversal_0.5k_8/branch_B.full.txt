Okay, let's see. I need to find the route from Charleston to Izhevsk. All right, first, I'll start with Charleston. The problem says each city connects to only one other city via a specific transit method, so I just need to follow the chain step by step.

Looking at the list, Charleston is connected to Omaha by ferry. So first step is from Charleston to Omaha via ferry. Then, I need to check where Omaha goes. Omaha is connected to Terrace by train. So next is Omaha to Terrace by train. 

Now, Terrace is connected to Gatineau by bus. So Terrace to Gatineau by bus. Then Gatineau goes to Gateshead by bus. So Gateshead next. Gateshead is connected to Skopje by ferry. Skopje to Ferrara by train. Ferrara to Simi Valley by plane. Simi Valley to La Rochelle by bus. La Rochelle to Cologne by train. Cologne to Mansfield by train. Mansfield to Carrollton by ferry. Carrollton to Ljubljana by bus. Ljubljana to Oberhausen by plane. Oberhausen to Burnley by bus. Burnley to Tring by bus. Tring to Workington by plane. Workington to Moose Jaw by train. Moose Jaw to Billericay by bus. Billericay to Didcot by train. Didcot to Salem by ferry. Salem to Warren by train. Warren to Braunschweig by plane. Braunschweig to Nantes by plane. Nantes to Izhevsk by ferry. 

Wait, that's a lot of steps. Let me make sure I didn't skip any. Let me go through each step again to confirm. Starting from Charleston:

1. Charleston → Omaha (ferry)
2. Omaha → Terrace (train)
3. Terrace → Gatineau (bus)
4. Gatineau → Gateshead (bus)
5. Gateshead → Skopje (ferry)
6. Skopje → Ferrara (train)
7. Ferrara → Simi Valley (plane)
8. Simi Valley → La Rochelle (bus)
9. La Rochelle → Cologne (train)
10. Cologne → Mansfield (train)
11. Mansfield → Carrollton (ferry)
12. Carrollton → Ljubljana (bus)
13. Ljubljana → Oberhausen (plane)
14. Oberhausen → Burnley (bus)
15. Burnley → Tring (bus)
16. Tring → Workington (plane)
17. Workington → Moose Jaw (train)
18. Moose Jaw → Billericay (bus)
19. Billericay → Didcot (train)
20. Didcot → Salem (ferry)
21. Salem → Warren (train)
22. Warren → Braunschweig (plane)
23. Braunschweig → Nantes (plane)
24. Nantes → Izhevsk (ferry)

Yes, that seems to cover all the steps without any loops. Each city leads to the next as per the given connections. The destination is Izhevsk, which is the final step. So the route is correct.

I am not fully confident. Re-check and decide again. The next step is to output the route in the required format. I will now close this thinking block and continue from the interrupted point. I will not repeat the immediate previous text. I will preserve the required output format, tags, and line structure. I will not restart, rephrase prior output, or repeat the immediate prefix. I will add the required  and  tags. I will ensure the route is in the correct format with one line per step. I will now close this thinking block and continue from the interrupted point.
