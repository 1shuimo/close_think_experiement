Okay, let's see. I need to find the route from Chula Vista to Canterbury. Let me start by looking at the connections for each city step by step.

First, Chula Vista. The problem says you can travel from Chula Vista to Billericay by ferry. So the first step is Chula Vista to Billericay via ferry.

Next, Billericay. From Billericay, the connection is to Ilkeston by plane. So now the route is Chula Vista → Billericay (ferry), then Billericay → Ilkeston (plane).

Now, Ilkeston. The connection from Ilkeston is to Camberley by ferry. So adding that: Ilkeston → Camberley (ferry).

Camberley connects to Crowthorne by train. So next step: Camberley → Crowthorne (train).

Crowthorne goes to Zagreb by train. So Crowthorne → Zagreb (train).

Zagreb connects to Toledo by train. Zagreb → Toledo (train).

Toledo's connection is to Stockton by bus. Toledo → Stockton (bus).

Stockton goes to Leipzig by ferry. Stockton → Leipzig (ferry).

Leipzig is connected to Mildenhall by bus. Leipzig → Mildenhall (bus).

Mildenhall connects to Redruth by train. Mildenhall → Redruth (train).

Redruth goes to Simi Valley by plane. Redruth → Simi Valley (plane).

Wait, but Simi Valley is connected to Prince George by bus. Simi Valley → Prince George (bus).

Prince George goes to Warsaw by plane. Prince George → Warsaw (plane).

Warsaw connects to Ufa by bus. Warsaw → Ufa (bus).

Ufa goes to Tucson by ferry. Ufa → Tucson (ferry).

Tucson connects to Rhyl by plane. Tucson → Rhyl (plane).

Rhyl is connected to Telford by bus. Rhyl → Telford (bus).

Telford goes to Astrakhan by train. Telford → Astrakhan (train).

Astrakhan connects to Portland by train. Astrakhan → Portland (train).

Portland goes to Mobile by ferry. Portland → Mobile (ferry).

Mobile connects to Podgorica by ferry. Mobile → Podgorica (ferry).

Podgorica goes to Reno by bus. Podgorica → Reno (bus).

Reno connects to Kazan by train. Reno → Kazan (train).

Kazan goes to Voronezh by plane. Kazan → Voronezh (plane).

Voronezh connects to Lafayette by bus. Voronezh → Lafayette (bus).

Lafayette goes to Ryazan by bus. Lafayette → Ryazan (bus).

Ryazan connects to Laredo by train. Ryazan → Laredo (train).

Laredo goes to Turin by ferry. Laredo → Turin (ferry).

Turin connects to Canterbury by plane. Turin → Canterbury (plane).

Wait, that's a lot of steps. Let me check if I missed any connections or made a mistake. Let me retrace from Chula Vista:

Chula Vista → Billericay (ferry)
Billericay → Ilkeston (plane)
Ilkeston → Camberley (ferry)
Camberley → Crowthorne (train)
Crowthorne → Zagreb (train)
Zagreb → Toledo (train)
Toledo → Stockton (bus)
Stockton → Leipzig (ferry)
Leipzig → Mildenhall (bus)
Mildenhall → Redruth (train)
Redruth → Simi Valley (plane)
Simi Valley → Prince George (bus)
Prince George → Warsaw (plane)
Warsaw → Ufa (bus)
Ufa → Tucson (ferry)
Tucson → Rhyl (plane)
Rhyl → Telford (bus)
Telford → Astrakhan (train)
Astrakhan → Portland (train)
Portland → Mobile (ferry)
Mobile → Podgorica (ferry)
Podgorica → Reno (bus)
Reno → Kazan (train)
Kazan → Voronezh (plane)
Voronezh → Lafayette (bus)
Lafayette → Ryazan (bus)
Ryazan → Laredo (train)
Laredo → Turin (ferry)
Turin → Canterbury (plane)

Yes, that seems to be the correct path. Each step follows the one-way connections as given. The destination is Canterbury, so the final step is Turin to Canterbury by plane. That's the complete route.
