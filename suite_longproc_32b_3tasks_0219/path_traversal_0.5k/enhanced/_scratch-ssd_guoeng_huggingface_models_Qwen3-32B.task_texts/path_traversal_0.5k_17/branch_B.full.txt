Okay, let's see. I need to find the route from Salzburg to Bedford. Let me start by looking at the connections step by step.

First, Salzburg is connected to Dortmund by ferry. So the first step is from Salzburg to Dortmund. Then, Dortmund goes to Mainz by train. So next is Dortmund to Mainz. Mainz is connected to Little Rock by bus. So now it's Mainz to Little Rock. Little Rock then goes to Metz by train. So next step is Little Rock to Metz. Metz is connected to Virginia Beach by train. So Metz to Virginia Beach. Virginia Beach goes to Workington by plane. Then Workington to Buffalo by ferry. Buffalo goes to Nizhny Novgorod by ferry. Nizhny Novgorod is connected to Gateshead by train. Gateshead then goes to Lincoln by ferry. Lincoln to Antibes by train. Antibes to Buxton by bus. Buxton to Cheboksary by plane. Cheboksary to Reims by ferry. Reims to Palmdale by train. Palmdale to Gainesville by plane. Gainesville to Brno by bus. Brno to Minneapolis by train. Minneapolis to Nanaimo by ferry. Nanaimo to Pistoia by bus. Pistoia to Reigate by bus. Reigate to Toulon by train. Toulon to Abingdon by bus. Abingdon to Tempe by ferry. Tempe to Oldenburg by train. Oldenburg to Honolulu by plane. Honolulu to Warlingham by bus. Warlingham to Kendal by ferry. Kendal to Swift Current by ferry. Swift Current to Courbevoie by plane. Courbevoie to Dayton by plane. Dayton to Cornwall by bus. Cornwall to Torrance by bus. Torrance to Bedford by plane. 

Wait, that's a lot of steps. Let me check each connection again to make sure I didn't skip any. Starting from Salzburg:

1. Salzburg → Dortmund (ferry)
2. Dortmund → Mainz (train)
3. Mainz → Little Rock (bus)
4. Little Rock → Metz (train)
5. Metz → Virginia Beach (train)
6. Virginia Beach → Workington (plane)
7. Workington → Buffalo (ferry)
8. Buffalo → Nizhny Novgorod (ferry)
9. Nizhny Novgorod → Gateshead (train)
10. Gateshead → Lincoln (ferry)
11. Lincoln → Antibes (train)
12. Antibes → Buxton (bus)
13. Buxton → Cheboksary (plane)
14. Cheboksary → Reims (ferry)
15. Reims → Palmdale (train)
16. Palmdale → Gainesville (plane)
17. Gainesville → Brno (bus)
18. Brno → Minneapolis (train)
19. Minneapolis → Nanaimo (ferry)
20. Nanaimo → Pistoia (bus)
21. Pistoia → Reigate (bus)
22. Reigate → Toulon (train)
23. Toulon → Abingdon (bus)
24. Abingdon → Tempe (ferry)
25. Tempe → Oldenburg (train)
26. Oldenburg → Honolulu (plane)
27. Honolulu → Warlingham (bus)
28. Warlingham → Kendal (ferry)
29. Kendal → Swift Current (ferry)
30. Swift Current → Courbevoie (plane)
31. Courbevoie → Dayton (plane)
32. Dayton → Cornwall (bus)
33. Cornwall → Torrance (bus)
34. Torrance → Bedford (plane)

Yes, that seems to cover all the steps from Salzburg to Bedford. Each step follows the one-way connections as given. I need to make sure there are no loops or missed connections. Let me verify a few key points. For example, from Brno to Minneapolis, then to Nanaimo, then to Pistoia, Reigate, Toulon, Abingdon, Tempe, Oldenburg, Honolulu, Warlingham, Kendal, Swift Current, Courbevoie, Dayton, Cornwall, Torrance, and finally Bedford. All these steps are present and follow the correct transit methods. I think this is the correct route.

Each step must be verified to ensure no deviation. The final step from Torrance to Bedford via plane is correct. The entire sequence is valid and follows the given connections.  
I am now confident.  
The route is correct as outlined.
