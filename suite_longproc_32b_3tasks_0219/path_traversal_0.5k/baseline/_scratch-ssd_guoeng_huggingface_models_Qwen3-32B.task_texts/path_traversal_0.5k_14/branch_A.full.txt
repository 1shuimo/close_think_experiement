Wait, but the destination is Canterbury. So the route should end there. Let me check if I missed any steps or took a wrong turn. Let me retrace from Stuttgart to see if there's a shorter path. But according to the problem, each city has only one outgoing connection, so there's only one possible path. So even if it's long, that's the route. Let me make sure I didn't skip any steps. Starting from Stuttgart, each step follows the only connection. So the entire path is as I listed, ending at Canterbury via Ramsgate. So the final route is all these steps combined.
