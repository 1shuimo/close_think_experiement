Okay, let's see. I need to find the route from Chula Vista to Canterbury. Each city is connected to exactly one other city via a specific transit method. So I'll start at Chula Vista and follow the connections step by step until I reach Canterbury.

First, looking at the list of cities and their connections. The problem says that from Chula Vista, you can travel to Billericay by ferry. So the first step is Chula Vista to Billericay via ferry.

Next, Billericay's connection is to Ilkeston by plane. So then I go from Billericay to Ilkeston. 

Ilkeston is connected to Camberley by ferry. So next step is Ilkeston to Camberley. 

Camberley goes to Crowthorne by train. So Camberley to Crowthorne. 

Crowthorne is connected to Zagreb by train. So then Crowthorne to Zagreb. 

Zagreb goes to Toledo by train. So Zagreb to Toledo. 

Toledo is connected to Stockton by bus. So Toledo to Stockton. 

Stockton goes to Leipzig by ferry. So Stockton to Leipzig. 

Leipzig is connected to Mildenhall by bus. So Leipzig to Mildenhall. 

Mildenhall goes to Redruth by train. So Mildenhall to Redruth. 

Redruth is connected to Simi Valley by plane. Hmm, that's a bit of a detour. So Redruth to Simi Valley. 

Simi Valley goes to Prince George by bus. So Simi Valley to Prince George. 

Prince George is connected to Warsaw by plane. So Prince George to Warsaw. 

Warsaw goes to Ufa by bus. So Warsaw to Ufa. 

Ufa is connected to Tucson by ferry. So Ufa to Tucson. 

Tucson goes to Rhyl by plane. So Tucson to Rhyl. 

Rhyl is connected to Telford by bus. Rhyl to Telford. 

Telford goes to Astrakhan by train. Telford to Astrakhan. 

Astrakhan is connected to Portland by train. Astrakhan to Portland. 

Portland goes to Mobile by ferry. Portland to Mobile. 

Mobile is connected to Podgorica by ferry. Mobile to Podgorica. 

Podgorica goes to Reno by bus. Podgorica to Reno. 

Reno is connected to Kazan by train. Reno to Kazan. 

Kazan goes to Voronezh by plane. Kazan to Voronezh. 

Voronezh is connected to Lafayette by bus. Voronezh to Lafayette. 

Lafayette goes to Ryazan by bus. Lafayette to Ryazan. 

Ryazan is connected to Laredo by train. Ryazan to Laredo. 

Laredo goes to Turin by ferry. Laredo to Turin. 

Turin is connected to Canterbury by plane. Finally, Turin to Canterbury. 

So putting all these steps together, the route from Chula Vista to Canterbury would be a long chain of these connections. Let me check each step again to make sure I didn't skip any or make a mistake. 

Starting from Chula Vista to Billericay (ferry), then Billericay to Ilkeston (plane), Ilkeston to Camberley (ferry), Camberley to Crowthorne (train), Crowthorne to Zagreb (train), Zagreb to Toledo (train), Toledo to Stockton (bus), Stockton to Leipzig (ferry), Leipzig to Mildenhall (bus), Mildenhall to Redruth (train), Redruth to Simi Valley (plane), Simi Valley to Prince George (bus), Prince George to Warsaw (plane), Warsaw to Ufa (bus), Ufa to Tucson (ferry), Tucson to Rhyl (plane), Rhyl to Telford (bus), Telford to Astrakhan (train), Astrakhan to Portland (train), Portland to Mobile (ferry), Mobile to Podgorica (ferry), Podgorica to Reno (bus), Reno to Kazan (train), Kazan to Voronezh (plane), Voronezh to Lafayette (bus), Lafayette to Ryazan (bus), Ryazan to Laredo (train), Laredo to Turin (ferry), and finally Turin to Canterbury (plane). 

That seems to cover all the steps without any loops or missing connections. I think that's the correct path.
