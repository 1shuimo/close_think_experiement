Okay, let's see. I need to find the route from Sassari to Oberhausen. Let me start by looking at the connections step by step.

First, Sassari is connected to Brest by plane. So the first step is from Sassari to Brest. Then, Brest is connected to Ryazan by ferry. So next is Brest to Ryazan. Ryazan goes to Caterham by bus. Then Caterham to Chita by bus. Chita to Chelmsford by ferry. Chelmsford to Norwich by ferry. Norwich to Bakersfield by ferry. Bakersfield to Porto by bus. Porto to Horley by ferry. Horley to Las Vegas by ferry. Las Vegas to Bonn by bus. Bonn to Udine by bus. Udine to Basildon by plane. Basildon to Kirov by train. Kirov to Margate by bus. Margate to Lisbon by train. Lisbon to Scunthorpe by plane. Scunthorpe to Olomouc by plane. Olomouc to Oceanside by ferry. Oceanside to Hagen by plane. Hagen to Tampa by ferry. Tampa to Augsburg by ferry. Augsburg to Sofia by bus. And finally, Sofia to Oberhausen by bus. 

Wait, let me check each step again to make sure I didn't skip anything. Starting from Sassari:

1. Sassari → Brest (plane)
2. Brest → Ryazan (ferry)
3. Ryazan → Caterham (bus)
4. Caterham → Chita (bus)
5. Chita → Chelmsford (ferry)
6. Chelmsford → Norwich (ferry)
7. Norwich → Bakersfield (ferry)
8. Bakersfield → Porto (bus)
9. Porto → Horley (ferry)
10. Horley → Las Vegas (ferry)
11. Las Vegas → Bonn (bus)
12. Bonn → Udine (bus)
13. Udine → Basildon (plane)
14. Basildon → Kirov (train)
15. Kirov → Margate (bus)
16. Margate → Lisbon (train)
17. Lisbon → Scunthorpe (plane)
18. Scunthorpe → Olomouc (plane)
19. Olomouc → Oceanside (ferry)
20. Oceanside → Hagen (plane)
21. Hagen → Tampa (ferry)
22. Tampa → Augsburg (ferry)
23. Augsburg → Sofia (bus)
24. Sofia → Oberhausen (bus)

Yes, that seems to cover all the steps without any loops or missing connections. Each city leads to the next as per the given data. The final destination is Oberhausen, so that's where it ends. I need to make sure each line is correctly formatted with the transit method and cities.
