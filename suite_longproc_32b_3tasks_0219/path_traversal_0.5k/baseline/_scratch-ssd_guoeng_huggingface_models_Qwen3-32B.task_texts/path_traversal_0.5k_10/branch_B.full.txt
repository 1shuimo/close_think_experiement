Okay, let's see. I need to find the route from Mildenhall to Chula Vista. Each city is connected to exactly one other city via a specific transit method, and all connections are one-way. So I have to start at Mildenhall and follow each connection step by step until I reach Chula Vista.

First, I'll check the given data for Mildenhall. The problem states that from Mildenhall, you can travel to Tamworth by plane. So the first step is Mildenhall → Tamworth by plane.

Next, I need to see where Tamworth connects to. The information says Tamworth is connected to Bonn by train. So now it's Tamworth → Bonn by train.

Now, looking at Bonn's connection. Bonn connects to Yonkers by ferry. So Bonn → Yonkers by ferry.

Yonkers is connected to Anaheim by train. So Yonkers → Anaheim by train.

Anaheim connects to Livorno by plane. So Anaheim → Livorno by plane.

Livorno is connected to Miami by train. So Livorno → Miami by train.

Miami connects to Toulouse by ferry. Miami → Toulouse by ferry.

Toulouse is connected to Magnitogorsk by train. Toulouse → Magnitogorsk by train.

Magnitogorsk goes to Porto by bus. Magnitogorsk → Porto by bus.

Porto connects to Rochester by train. Porto → Rochester by train.

Rochester is connected to Salinas by bus. Rochester → Salinas by bus.

Salinas connects to Nanaimo by ferry. Salinas → Nanaimo by ferry.

Nanaimo is connected to Ivanovo by train. Nanaimo → Ivanovo by train.

Ivanovo goes to Tucson by bus. Ivanovo → Tucson by bus.

Tucson connects to Freiburg by ferry. Tucson → Freiburg by ferry.

Freiburg is connected to Lethbridge by bus. Freiburg → Lethbridge by bus.

Lethbridge goes to Durham by bus. Lethbridge → Durham by bus.

Durham connects to Bolzano by bus. Durham → Bolzano by bus.

Bolzano is connected to Mainz by train. Bolzano → Mainz by train.

Mainz connects to Ravenna by bus. Mainz → Ravenna by bus.

Ravenna is connected to Jersey City by plane. Ravenna → Jersey City by plane.

Jersey City goes to Lincoln by ferry. Jersey City → Lincoln by ferry.

Lincoln connects to Solihull by ferry. Lincoln → Solihull by ferry.

Solihull is connected to Chula Vista by train. Solihull → Chula Vista by train.

Wait, that's a lot of steps. Let me make sure I didn't miss any. Let me go through each step again to confirm.

Starting from Mildenhall:
1. Mildenhall → Tamworth (plane)
2. Tamworth → Bonn (train)
3. Bonn → Yonkers (ferry)
4. Yonkers → Anaheim (train)
5. Anaheim → Livorno (plane)
6. Livorno → Miami (train)
7. Miami → Toulouse (ferry)
8. Toulouse → Magnitogorsk (train)
9. Magnitogorsk → Porto (bus)
10. Porto → Rochester (train)
11. Rochester → Salinas (bus)
12. Salinas → Nanaimo (ferry)
13. Nanaimo → Ivanovo (train)
14. Ivanovo → Tucson (bus)
15. Tucson → Freiburg (ferry)
16. Freiburg → Lethbridge (bus)
17. Lethbridge → Durham (bus)
18. Durham → Bolzano (bus)
19. Bolzano → Mainz (train)
20. Mainz → Ravenna (bus)
21. Ravenna → Jersey City (plane)
22. Jersey City → Lincoln (ferry)
23. Lincoln → Solihull (ferry)
24. Solihull → Chula Vista (train)

Yes, that seems to be the correct path. Each step follows the one-way connections as given. I need to make sure that each city is only connected to the next one as per the problem's data. Let me check a few key points again. For example, from Solihull, the connection is to Chula Vista by train, which is correct. And from there, we reach the destination. So the entire route is 24 steps long. But the problem says that each city is connected to only one other, so there's only one possible route. Therefore, this must be the correct path.
