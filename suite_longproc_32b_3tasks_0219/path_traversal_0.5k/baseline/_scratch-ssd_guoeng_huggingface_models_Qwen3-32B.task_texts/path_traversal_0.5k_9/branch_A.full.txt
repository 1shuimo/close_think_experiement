Okay, let's see. I need to find the route from Cheboksary to Lubbock. Each city is connected to exactly one other city via a specific transit method. So I'll start at Cheboksary and follow the connections step by step until I reach Lubbock.

First, looking at the list of cities and their connections. Cheboksary is mentioned here: "Cheboksary is a lively city. You can travel from Cheboksary to Rochester by plane." So the first step is from Cheboksary to Rochester by plane.

Next, Rochester's connection: "Rochester is a lively city. You can travel from Rochester to Chichester by bus." So from Rochester, I take a bus to Chichester.

Chichester's connection: "Chichester is a lively city. You can travel from Chichester to Hitchin by plane." So now, plane to Hitchin.

Hitchin's connection: "Hitchin is a lively city. You can travel from Hitchin to Oakland by plane." So plane to Oakland.

Oakland's connection: "Oakland is a lively city. You can travel from Oakland to Nashville by plane." Plane to Nashville.

Izhevsk's connection: "Izhevsk is a lively city. You can travel from Izhevsk to Cedar Rapids by ferry." Ferry to Cedar Rapids.

Cedar Rapids's connection: "Cedar Rapids is a lively city. You can travel from Cedar Rapids to Wuppertal by ferry." Ferry to Wuppertal.

Wuppertal's connection: "Wuppertal is a lively city. You can travel from Wuppertal to Bremen by bus." Bus to Bremen.

Bremen's connection: "Bremen is a lively city. You can travel from Bremen to Makhachkala by train." Train to Makhachkala.

Makhachkala's connection: "Makhachkala is a lively city. You can travel from Makhachkala to Rennes by ferry." Ferry to Rennes.

Rennes's connection: "Rennes is a lively city. You can travel from Rennes to Catania by train." Train to Catania.

Catania's connection: "Catania is a lively city. You can travel from Catania to Concord by ferry." Ferry to Concord.

Concord's connection: "Concord is a lively city. You can travel from Concord to Bletchley by plane." Plane to Bletchley.

Bletchley's connection: "Bletchley is a lively city. You can travel from Bletchley to Abingdon by ferry." Ferry to Abingdon.

Abingdon's connection: "Abingdon is a lively city. You can travel from Abingdon to Lviv by ferry." Ferry to Lviv.

Lviv's connection: "Lviv is a lively city. You can travel from Lviv to Chelmsford by bus." Bus to Chelmsford.

Chelmsford's connection: "Chelmsford is a lively city. You can travel from Chelmsford to Chisinau by plane." Plane to Chisinau.

Chisinau's connection: "Chisinau is a lively city. You can travel from Chisinau to Raleigh by plane." Plane to Raleigh.

Raleigh's connection: "Raleigh is a lively city. You can travel from Raleigh to Reykjavik by bus." Bus to Reykjavik.

Reykjavik's connection: "Reykjavik is a lively city. You can travel from Reykjavik to Plovdiv by train." Train to Plovdiv.

Workington's connection: "Workington is a lively city. You can travel from Workington to Lipetsk by plane." Plane to Lipetsk.

Lipetsk's connection: "Lipetsk is a lively city. You can travel from Lipetsk to Peoria by bus." Bus to Peoria.

Peoria's connection: "Peoria is a lively city. You can travel from Peoria to Lubbock by train." Finally, train to Lubbock. That's the destination!

So putting all these steps together, each step is a line in the route. Let me check each connection again to make sure I didn't skip any or make a mistake. For example, from Cheboksary to Rochester, then Rochester to Chichester, etc. Each step follows the one-way connection. And the final step is Peoria to Lubbock by train. That should be the correct path.
