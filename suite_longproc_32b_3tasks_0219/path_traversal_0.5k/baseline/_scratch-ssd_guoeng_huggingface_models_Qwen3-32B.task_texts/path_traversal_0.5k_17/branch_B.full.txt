Okay, let's try to figure out the route from Salzburg to Bedford. First, I need to start at Salzburg and follow each connection step by step until I reach Bedford. Let me jot down each step as I go.

Starting at Salzburg. According to the given data, Salzburg is connected to Dortmund by ferry. So the first step is Salzburg → Dortmund via ferry.

Next, Dortmund connects to Mainz by train. So now we're at Mainz. From Mainz, the connection is to Little Rock by bus. So Mainz → Little Rock via bus.

Little Rock then connects to Metz by train. So Little Rock → Metz via train.

Metz is connected to Virginia Beach by train. Wait, no, looking back, Metz → Virginia Beach by train? Let me check again. Yes, the data says Metz to Virginia Beach by train. So Metz → Virginia Beach via train.

Virginia Beach connects to Workington by plane. So Virginia Beach → Workington via plane.

Workington then goes to Buffalo by ferry. Workington → Buffalo via ferry.

Buffalo connects to Nizhny Novgorod by ferry. So Buffalo → Nizhny Novgorod via ferry.

Nizhny Novgorod is connected to Gateshead by train. Nizhny Novgorod → Gateshead via train.

Gateshead connects to Lincoln by ferry. Gateshead → Lincoln via ferry.

Lincoln goes to Antibes by train. Lincoln → Antibes via train.

Antibes connects to Buxton by bus. Antibes → Buxton via bus.

Buxton is connected to Cheboksary by plane. Buxton → Cheboksary via plane.

Cheboksary goes to Reims by ferry. Cheboksary → Reims via ferry.

Reims connects to Palmdale by train. Reims → Palmdale via train.

Palmdale is connected to Gainesville by plane. Palmdale → Gainesville via plane.

Gainesville goes to Brno by bus. Gainesville → Brno via bus.

Brno connects to Minneapolis by train. Brno → Minneapolis via train.

Minneapolis is connected to Nanaimo by ferry. Minneapolis → Nanaimo via ferry.

Nanaimo goes to Pistoia by bus. Nanaimo → Pistoia via bus.

Pistoia connects to Reigate by bus. Pistoia → Reigate via bus.

Reigate is connected to Toulon by train. Reigate → Toulon via train.

Toulon goes to Abingdon by bus. Toulon → Abingdon via bus.

Abingdon connects to Tempe by ferry. Abingdon → Tempe via ferry.

Tempe is connected to Oldenburg by train. Tempe → Oldenburg via train.

Oldenburg goes to Honolulu by plane. Oldenburg → Honolulu via plane.

Honolulu connects to Warlingham by bus. Honolulu → Warlingham via bus.

Warlingham is connected to Kendal by ferry. Warlingham → Kendal via ferry.

Kendal connects to Swift Current by ferry. Kendal → Swift Current via ferry.

Swift Current goes to Courbevoie by plane. Swift Current → Courbevoie via plane.

Courbevoie connects to Dayton by plane. Courbevoie → Dayton via plane.

Dayton is connected to Cornwall by bus. Dayton → Cornwall via bus.

Cornwall connects to Torrance by bus. Cornwall → Torrance via bus.

Torrance goes to Bedford by plane. Torrance → Bedford via plane. Finally, we reach Bedford!

Let me check if I missed any steps or took a wrong turn. Starting from Salzburg, each step follows the one-way connections. Let me verify each connection again to make sure I didn't make a mistake. For example, from Salzburg to Dortmund (ferry) is correct. Then Dortmund to Mainz (train), Mainz to Little Rock (bus), Little Rock to Metz (train), Metz to Virginia Beach (train), Virginia Beach to Workington (plane), Workington to Buffalo (ferry), Buffalo to Nizhny Novgorod (ferry), Nizhny Novgorod to Gateshead (train), Gateshead to Lincoln (ferry), Lincoln to Antibes (train), Antibes to Buxton (bus), Buxton to Cheboksary (plane), Cheboksary to Reims (ferry), Reims to Palmdale (train), Palmdale to Gainesville (plane), Gainesville to Brno (bus), Brno to Minneapolis (train), Minneapolis to Nanaimo (ferry), Nanaimo to Pistoia (bus), Pistoia to Reigate (bus), Reigate to Toulon (train), Toulon to Abingdon (bus), Abingdon to Tempe (ferry), Tempe to Oldenburg (train), Oldenburg to Honolulu (plane), Honolulu to Warlingham (bus), Warlingham to Kendal (ferry), Kendal to Swift Current (ferry), Swift Current to Courbevoie (plane), Courbevoie to Dayton (plane), Dayton to Cornwall (bus), Cornwall to Torrance (bus), Torrance to Bedford (plane). 

Yes, that seems to cover all the steps without any loops or missing connections. The route from Salzburg to Bedford is quite long, but each step follows the given connections correctly. I think this is the correct path.
