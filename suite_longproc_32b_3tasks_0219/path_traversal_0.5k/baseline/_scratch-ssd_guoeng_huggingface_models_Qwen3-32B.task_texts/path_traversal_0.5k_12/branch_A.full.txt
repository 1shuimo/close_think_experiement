8. Stockton to Trondheim (bus)
9. Trondheim to Lubbock (bus)
10. Lubbock to Stevenage (ferry)

36. Ravenna to Herne (ferry)
37. Herne to Naberezhnye Chelny (ferry)
38. Naberezhnye Chelny to Leverkusen (ferry)
39. Leverkusen to Cheboksary (ferry)

That's a lot of steps, but each one follows the one-way connections. I need to make sure that each step is correctly connected and that there are no loops or missed connections. Let me verify a few key points. For example, after Rochdale to Kassel, then Kassel to Anaheim, then Anaheim to Gatineau, etc. All these transitions are valid based on the given data. The final step from Leverkusen to Cheboksary is correct. So the entire route is valid and follows the one-way connections as specified.
