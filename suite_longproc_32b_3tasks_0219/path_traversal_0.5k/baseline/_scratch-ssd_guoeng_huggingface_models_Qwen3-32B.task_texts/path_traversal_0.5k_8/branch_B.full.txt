Okay, let's see. I need to find the route from Charleston to Izhevsk. All right, first, I should start by looking at where Charleston connects to. The problem says each city has only one outgoing connection, so there's only one path to follow each time.

Looking at the list, the entry for Charleston says: "You can travel from Charleston to Omaha by ferry." So the first step is Charleston to Omaha via ferry. Now, I need to check where Omaha goes next. The Omaha entry is: "You can travel from Omaha to Terrace by train." So next is Omaha to Terrace by train.

Now, Terrace's connection is: "You can travel from Terrace to Gatineau by bus." So Terrace to Gatineau by bus. Then Gatineau's connection is: "Gatineau to Gateshead by bus." So Gatineau to Gateshead by bus.

Gateshead's entry: "Gateshead to Skopje by ferry." So Gateshead to Skopje by ferry. Skopje connects to Ferrara by train. Then Ferrara to Simi Valley by plane. Simi Valley to La Rochelle by bus. La Rochelle to Cologne by train. Cologne to Mansfield by train. Mansfield to Carrollton by ferry. Carrollton to Ljubljana by bus. Ljubljana to Oberhausen by plane. Oberhausen to Burnley by bus. Burnley to Tring by bus. Tring to Workington by plane. Workington to Moose Jaw by train. Moose Jaw to Billericay by bus. Billericay to Didcot by train. Didcot to Salem by ferry. Salem to Warren by train. Warren to Braunschweig by plane. Braunschweig to Nantes by plane. Nantes to Izhevsk by ferry. 

Wait, that's a lot of steps. Let me make sure I didn't skip any. Let me go step by step again:

1. Charleston → Omaha (ferry)
2. Omaha → Terrace (train)
3. Terrace → Gatineau (bus)
4. Gatineau → Gateshead (bus)
5. Gateshead → Skopje (ferry)
6. Skopje → Ferrara (train)
7. Ferrara → Simi Valley (plane)
8. Simi Valley → La Rochelle (bus)
9. La Rochelle → Cologne (train)
10. Cologne → Mansfield (train)
11. Mansfield → Carrollton (ferry)
12. Carrollton → Ljubljana (bus)
13. Ljubljana → Oberhausen (plane)
14. Oberhausen → Burnley (bus)
15. Burnley → Tring (bus)
16. Tring → Workington (plane)
17. Workington → Moose Jaw (train)
18. Moose Jaw → Billericay (bus)
19. Billericay → Didcot (train)
20. Didcot → Salem (ferry)
21. Salem → Warren (train)
22. Warren → Braunschweig (plane)
23. Braunschweig → Nantes (plane)
24. Nantes → Izhevsk (ferry)

Yes, that seems to cover all the steps from Charleston to Izhevsk. Each step follows the one-way connections as given. I need to make sure there are no loops or missed steps. Let me check each transition again to confirm. For example, after La Rochelle, it's to Cologne, then to Mansfield, etc. All transitions are valid based on the provided data. The final step is Nantes to Izhevsk by ferry, which is the destination. So the route is correct.
