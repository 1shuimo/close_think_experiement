Wait, that's a long route. Let me check if I missed any steps or made a mistake. Starting from Raleigh, each step follows the one-way connections. Let me verify each step again to make sure I didn't skip anything or take a wrong turn. For example, after Raleigh to Grand Rapids, then Grand Rapids to Blackburn, yes. Then Blackburn to Harrogate, correct. Harrogate to Fort Wayne, yes. Fort Wayne to Luton, correct. Luton to Wisbech, then Wisbech to Penza, Penza to Killeen, Killeen to Leipzig, Leipzig to Kingston, Kingston to Mostar, Mostar to Gatineau, Gatineau to Rimini, Rimini to Bergamo, Bergamo to Ufa, Ufa to Orange, Orange to Royston, Royston to Ancona, Ancona to Sidcup, Sidcup to Limoges, Limoges to Duisburg, Duisburg to Folkestone, Folkestone to Eugene, Eugene to Winchester, Winchester to Walsall, Walsall to Tomsk, Tomsk to Dresden, Dresden to Naples, and finally Naples to Detroit. That seems to cover all the steps without any loops or missing connections. So the route is correct.
