Okay, let's see. I need to find the route from Fort McMurray to Shreveport. Each city connects to only one other city via a specific transit method. So I'll start at Fort McMurray and follow each connection step by step until I reach Shreveport.

First, Fort McMurray's connection: the problem says you can travel from Fort McMurray to Vladivostok by bus. So the first step is Fort McMurray → Vladivostok by bus.

Next, Vladivostok connects to Bletchley by train. So now I'm at Vladivostok → Bletchley by train.

Bletchley connects to Ravenna by plane. So next step: Bletchley → Ravenna by plane.

Ravenna connects to Fort Wayne by train. So Ravenna → Fort Wayne by train.

Fort Wayne connects to Little Rock by bus. So Fort Wayne → Little Rock by bus.

Little Rock connects to Harrogate by bus. So Little Rock → Harrogate by bus.

Harrogate connects to Hoddesdon by train. So Harrogate → Hoddesdon by train.

Hoddesdon connects to Sunnyvale by bus. So Hoddesdon → Sunnyvale by bus.

Sunnyvale connects to Le Mans by plane. Sunnyvale → Le Mans by plane.

Le Mans connects to Antwerp by train. Le Mans → Antwerp by train.

Antwerp connects to Tirana by train. Antwerp → Tirana by train.

Tirana connects to Lafayette by bus. Tirana → Lafayette by bus.

Lafayette connects to Fayetteville by train. Lafayette → Fayetteville by train.

Fayetteville connects to Stockton by plane. Fayetteville → Stockton by plane.

Stockton connects to Novi Sad by bus. Stockton → Novi Sad by bus.

Novi Sad connects to Sofia by bus. Novi Sad → Sofia by bus.

Sofia connects to Buxton by ferry. Sofia → Buxton by ferry.

Buxton connects to Gilbert by bus. Buxton → Gilbert by bus.

Gilbert connects to Avignon by bus. Gilbert → Avignon by bus.

Avignon connects to Aurora by plane. Avignon → Aurora by plane.

Aurora connects to Giugliano in Campania by bus. Aurora → Giugliano in Campania by bus.

Giugliano in Campania connects to Fort Lauderdale by plane. Giugliano → Fort Lauderdale by plane.

Fort Lauderdale connects to Perm by bus. Fort Lauderdale → Perm by bus.

Perm connects to Aarhus by plane. Perm → Aarhus by plane.

Aarhus connects to Stavropol by plane. Aarhus → Stavropol by plane.

Stavropol connects to Tucson by ferry. Stavropol → Tucson by ferry.

Tucson connects to Astrakhan by train. Tucson → Astrakhan by train.

Astrakhan connects to Toulon by plane. Astrakhan → Toulon by plane.

Toulon connects to Modena by ferry. Toulon → Modena by ferry.

Modena connects to Dunkirk by plane. Modena → Dunkirk by plane.

Dunkirk connects to Oakland by train. Dunkirk → Oakland by train.

Oakland connects to Dudley by bus. Oakland → Dudley by bus.

Dudley connects to Lille by plane. Dudley → Lille by plane.

Lille connects to Shreveport by ferry. Lille → Shreveport by ferry. Finally, we reach Shreveport!

So putting all these steps together, the route from Fort McMurray to Shreveport would be all these steps in order. Let me check each connection again to make sure I didn't skip any steps or make a mistake. For example, from Fort McMurray to Vladivostok (bus), then Vladivostok to Bletchley (train), Bletchley to Ravenna (plane), etc. Each step is correct based on the given data. The final step is Lille to Shreveport by ferry. So the entire route is correct.
