That seems to be the full path. I need to make sure each step is correct based on the given connections. Let me cross-check each one with the problem's data. For example, York to Marseille by ferry is correct. Marseille to Des Moines by ferry is correct. Des Moines to Klaipeda by bus is correct. Klaipeda to Salerno by plane is correct.
