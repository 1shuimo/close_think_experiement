I need to find the route from Bordon to Wellingborough. Each city is connected to exactly one other city via a specific transit method, and all connections are one-way. So I'll start at Bordon and follow each step until I reach Wellingborough.\n\nFirst, looking at the list of cities and their connections. Bordon is a lively city.

I need to find the route from Hampton to Cheboksary. Let me start by looking at the connections for each city step by step.\n\nFirst, Hampton. The problem says you can travel from Hampton to Oldenburg by ferry. So the first step is Hampton to Oldenburg via ferry.\n\nNext, Oldenburg. The connections mention that Oldenburg can go to Salerno by bus. So from Oldenburg, take a bus to Salerno.\n\nNow, Salerno's connection is to Antibes by ferry. So next step is Salerno to Antibes by ferry.\n\nAntibes connects to Olomouc by plane. So from Antibes, take a plane to Olomouc.\n\nOlomouc goes to Solihull by plane.

Finally, that's the destination.\n\nSo putting it all together, the route from Hampton to Cheboksary would be a long chain of these steps. Let me check each step again to make sure I didn't skip any or make a mistake.\n\nStarting from Hampton:\n\n1. Hampton to Oldenburg (ferry)\n2. Oldenburg to Salerno (bus)\n3. Salerno to Antibes (ferry)\n4. Antibes to Olomouc (plane)\n5. Olomouc to Solihull (plane)\n6. Solihull to Swindon (plane)\n7. Swindon to Stockton (bus)\n8. Stockton to Trondheim (bus)\n9.

Naberezhnye Chelny to Leverkusen (ferry)\n39. Leverkusen to Cheboksary (ferry)\n\nThat's a lot of steps, but each one follows the one-way connections. I need to make sure that each step is correctly connected and that there are no loops or missed connections. Let me verify a few key points. For example, after Rochdale to Kassel, then Kassel to Anaheim, then Anaheim to Gatineau, etc. All these transitions are valid based on the given data. The final step from Leverkusen to Cheboksary is correct. So the entire route is valid and follows the one-way connections as specified.\n</think>\n\n<Route>\nFrom Hampton, take a ferry to Oldenburg.\nFrom Oldenburg, take a bus to Salerno.\nFrom Salerno,

I need to make sure that each step is correctly connected and that there are no loops or missed connections. Let me verify a few key points. For example, after Rochdale to Kassel, then Kassel to Anaheim, then Anaheim to Gatineau, etc. All these transitions are valid based on the given data. The final step from Leverkusen to Cheboksary is correct.

I need to find the route from Matlock to Varna. Each city is connected to exactly one other city via a specific transit method. So I should start at Matlock and follow the connections step by step until I reach Varna.\n\nFirst, looking at the list of cities and their connections. The problem says each city has a one-way connection to another. Let me check the details provided.\n\nMatlock is mentioned here: \"Matlock is a lively city. You can travel from Matlock to Dortmund by plane.\" So the first step is from Matlock to Dortmund by plane.\n\nNow, Dortmund's connection: \"Dortmund is a lively city. You can travel from Dortmund to Orillia by bus.\" So next is Dortmund to Orillia by bus.\n\nOrillia's connection: \"Orillia is a lively city. You can travel from Orillia to Nice by bus.\" So then Orillia to Nice by bus.\n\nNice's connection: \"Nice is a lively city.

Ah, here we go! So once we reach Potton, the next step is to Varna by bus. \n\nSo putting it all together, the route from Matlock to Varna would be:\n\nMatlock → Dortmund (plane)\nDortmund → Orillia (bus)\nOrillia → Nice (bus)\nNice → Coalville (plane)\nCoalville → Hitchin (ferry)\nHitchin → Ancona (ferry)\nAncona → Aylesbury (plane)\nAylesbury → Amiens (bus)\nAmiens → Nizhny Novgorod (train)\nNizhny Novgorod → Madrid (train)\nMadrid → Little Rock (train)\nLittle Rock → Laredo (plane)\nLaredo → La Rochelle (train)\nLa Rochelle → Tours (bus)\nTours → Garden Grove (plane)\nGarden Grove → Salzburg (train)\nSalzburg → Horley (bus)\nHorley → Fayetteville (train)\nFayetteville → Fort Lauderdale (ferry)\nFort Lauderdale → Billericay (ferry)\nBillericay → Belgrade (bus)\nBelgrade → Stavropol (bus)\nStavropol → Orange (ferry)\nOrange → Aarhus (bus)\nAarhus → Mainz (plane)\nMainz → Harrogate (plane)\nHarrogate → Rancho Cucamonga (ferry)\nRancho Cucamonga → Podgorica (plane)\nPodgorica → Killeen (bus)\nKilleen → Worthing (bus)\nWorthing → Eugene (plane)\nEugene → Ongar (ferry)\nOngar → Potton (ferry)\nPotton → Varna (bus)\n\nThat's a long route, but each step follows the one-way connections. Let me double-check each step to make sure I didn't miss any. For example, from Matlock to Dortmund is correct. Then Dortmund to Orillia by bus. Orillia to Nice by bus.

I need to find the route from Matlock to Varna. Each city is connected to exactly one other city via a specific transit method. So I should start at Matlock and follow the connections step by step until I reach Varna.\n\nFirst, looking at the list of cities and their connections. The problem says each city has a one-way connection to another. Let me check the details provided.\n\nMatlock is mentioned here: \"Matlock is a lively city.

For example, from York to Marseille, then Marseille to Des Moines, Des Moines to Klaipeda, Klaipeda to Salerno, Salerno to Laredo, Laredo to Thornton, Thornton to Memphis, Memphis to Bremen, Bremen to Catania, Catania to Huntsville, Huntsville to Sterling Heights, Sterling Heights to Cincinnati, Cincinnati to Middlesbrough, Middlesbrough to Cheboksary, Cheboksary to Hollywood, Hollywood to Kaliningrad, Kaliningrad to Potsdam, Potsdam to Mesa, Mesa to Exeter, Exeter to Gothenburg, Gothenburg to Swindon, Swindon to Carlisle, Carlisle to Tring, Tring to Genoa, Genoa to Huntingdon, Huntingdon to Samara, Samara to Ulverston, Ulverston to Haverhill, Haverhill to Bruges, Bruges to Escondido, Escondido to Augusta, Augusta to Windsor, Windsor to Miramar, and finally Miramar to Krefeld. That seems to be the full path. I need to make sure each step is correct based on the given connections. Let me cross-check each one with the problem's data. For example, York to Marseille by ferry is correct. Marseille to Des Moines by ferry is correct. Des Moines to Klaipeda by bus is correct. Klaipeda to Salerno by plane is correct.
