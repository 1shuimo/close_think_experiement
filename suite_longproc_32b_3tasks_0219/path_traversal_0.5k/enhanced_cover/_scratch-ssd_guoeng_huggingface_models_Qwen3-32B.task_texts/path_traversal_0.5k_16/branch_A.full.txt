Okay, let's see. I need to find the route from Fort McMurray to Shreveport. Each city only connects to one other city via a specific transit method, so I can just follow the chain step by step.

Starting at Fort McMurray. The description says you can travel from Fort McMurray to Vladivostok by bus. So first step is Fort McMurray to Vladivostok by bus.

Next, Vladivostok connects to Bletchley by train. So then from Vladivostok to Bletchley by train.

Bletchley connects to Ravenna by plane. So next is Bletchley to Ravenna by plane.

Ravenna goes to Fort Wayne by train. So Ravenna to Fort Wayne by train.

Fort Wayne connects to Little Rock by bus. So Fort Wayne to Little Rock by bus.

Little Rock goes to Harrogate by bus. Then Harrogate to Hoddesdon by train.

Hoddesdon connects to Sunnyvale by bus. Sunnyvale to Le Mans by plane.

Le Mans goes to Antwerp by train. Antwerp to Tirana by train.

Tirana connects to Lafayette by bus. Lafayette to Fayetteville by train.

Fayetteville goes to Stockton by plane. Stockton to Novi Sad by bus.

Novi Sad connects to Sofia by bus. Sofia to Buxton by ferry.

Buxton goes to Gilbert by bus. Gilbert to Avignon by bus.

Avignon connects to Aurora by plane. Aurora to Giugliano in Campania by bus.

Giugliano in Campania goes to Fort Lauderdale by plane. Fort Lauderdale to Perm by bus.

Perm connects to Aarhus by plane. Aarhus to Stavropol by plane.

Stavropol goes to Tucson by ferry. Tucson to Astrakhan by train.

Astrakhan connects to Toulon by plane. Toulon to Modena by ferry.

Modena goes to Dunkirk by plane. Dunkirk to Oakland by train.

Oakland connects to Dudley by bus. Dudley to Lille by plane.

Lille goes to Shreveport by ferry. Finally, Shreveport is the destination.

So putting all these steps together, the route should be from Fort McMurray to Vladivostok by bus, then Vladivostok to Bletchley by train, and so on until reaching Shreveport via Lille's ferry.
