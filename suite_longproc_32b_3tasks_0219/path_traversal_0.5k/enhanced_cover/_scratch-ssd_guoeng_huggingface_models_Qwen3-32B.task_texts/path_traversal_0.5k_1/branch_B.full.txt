Okay, let's see. I need to find the route from Lille to Bromsgrove. Let me start by looking at the connections for each city step by step.

First, Lille is connected to Abingdon by ferry. So the first step is from Lille to Abingdon. Then, Abingdon's connection is to Augsburg by bus. From Augsburg, the transit is to Lecce by plane. Lecce connects to Vladivostok by plane. Vladivostok goes to Guildford by ferry. Guildford's next is Gelsenkirchen by ferry. Gelsenkirchen connects to Kamloops by train. Kamloops goes to Fort Collins by ferry. Fort Collins is connected to Basingstoke by train. Basingstoke then goes to Medicine Hat by plane. Medicine Hat's connection is to Tallinn by ferry. Tallinn goes to Grantham by ferry. Grantham connects to Folkestone by bus. Folkestone's next is Reno by ferry. Reno goes to Lafayette by plane. Lafayette connects to Tucson by ferry. Tucson's transit is to Gateshead by train. Gateshead goes to Marlow by ferry. Marlow connects to Trento by train. Trento goes to Salt Lake City by bus. Salt Lake City is connected to Windermere by ferry. Windermere's next is Colorado Springs by bus. Colorado Springs goes to Sandhurst by bus. Sandhurst connects to Erfurt by ferry. Erfurt's transit is to Sochi by train. Sochi goes to Killeen by ferry. Killeen connects to Bolzano by train. Bolzano's next is Terrace by bus. Terrace goes to Sacramento by plane. Sacramento connects to Kendal by ferry. Kendal's connection is to Fort McMurray by plane. Fort McMurray goes to Versailles by train. Versailles connects to West Valley City by ferry. West Valley City goes to Crewe by plane. Crewe's next is Worthing by plane. Worthing connects to Bournemouth by ferry. Bournemouth goes to Cornwall by plane. Cornwall is connected to Vladikavkaz by ferry. Vladikavkaz's transit is to Bromsgrove by plane. 

Wait, so from Lille to Abingdon, then to Augsburg, Lecce, Vladivostok, Guildford, Gelsenkirchen, Kamloops, Fort Collins, Basingstoke, Medicine Hat, Tallinn, Grantham, Folkestone, Reno, Lafayette, Tucson, Gateshead, Marlow, Trento, Salt Lake City, Windermere, Colorado Springs, Sandhurst, Erfurt, Sochi, Killeen, Bolzano, Terrace, Sacramento, Kendal, Fort McMurray, Versailles, West Valley City, Crewe, Worthing, Bournemouth, Cornwall, Vladikavkaz, and finally to Bromsgrove. That's a long route, but each step follows the one-way connections. Let me double-check each step to make sure I didn't skip any or make a mistake. For example, from Sandhurst to Erfurt by ferry, then Erfurt to Sochi by train, Sochi to Killeen by ferry, Killeen to Bolzano by train, Bolzano to Terrace by bus, Terrace to Sacramento by plane, Sacramento to Kendal by ferry, Kendal to Fort McMurray by plane, Fort McMurray to Versailles by train, Versailles to West Valley City by ferry, West Valley City to Crewe by plane, Crewe to Worthing by plane, Worthing to Bournemouth by ferry, Bournemouth to Cornwall by plane, Cornwall to Vladikavkaz by ferry, and Vladikavkaz to Bromsgrove by plane. Yes, that seems correct. Each step is a direct connection as per the given data. So the entire route is correct.
