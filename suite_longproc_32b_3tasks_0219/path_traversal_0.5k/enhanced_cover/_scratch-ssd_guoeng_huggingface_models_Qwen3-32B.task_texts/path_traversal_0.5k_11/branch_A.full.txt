Okay, let's see. I need to find the route from Krakow to Tampa. Each city connects to only one other city via a specific transit method. So I'll start at Krakow and follow the connections step by step.

First, looking at the list: Krakow is connected to Stockton by bus. So the first step is Krakow to Stockton via bus. Then, Stockton connects to Toledo by train. Next, Toledo is connected to Kirov by bus. Kirov goes to Poitiers by plane. Poitiers connects to Harpenden by train. Harpenden to Reigate by plane. Reigate to Bridgwater by train. Bridgwater to Halifax by ferry. Halifax to Durham by bus. Durham to Tring by train. Tring to Cary by ferry. Cary to Hoddesdon by ferry. Hoddesdon to Bath by plane. Bath to Preston by plane. Preston to Tamworth by ferry. Tamworth to Amiens by plane. Amiens to Simi Valley by ferry. Simi Valley to Loughborough by ferry. Loughborough to Warsaw by ferry. Warsaw to Irvine by plane. Irvine to Barnaul by train. Barnaul to Berlin by ferry. Berlin to Swift Current by bus. Swift Current to Solihull by bus. Solihull to Mostar by plane. Mostar to Lisbon by ferry. Lisbon to Bromley by ferry. Bromley to Kent by train. Kent to Limoges by train. Limoges to Thatcham by bus. Thatcham to Argenteuil by bus. Argenteuil to Marseille by bus. Marseille to Barrie by bus. Barrie to Southend by ferry. Southend to Bratislava by bus. Bratislava to Little Rock by train. Little Rock to Bucharest by ferry. Bucharest to Huddersfield by plane. Huddersfield to Tampa by train. 

Wait, but I need to check if I'm going the right way. Let me retrace each step carefully. Starting from Krakow:

1. Krakow → Stockton (bus)
2. Stockton → Toledo (train)
3. Toledo → Kirov (bus)
4. Kirov → Poitiers (plane)
5. Poitiers → Harpenden (train)
6. Harpenden → Reigate (plane)
7. Reigate → Bridgwater (train)
8. Bridgwater → Halifax (ferry)
9. Halifax → Durham (bus)
10. Durham → Tring (train)
11. Tring → Cary (ferry)
12. Cary → Hoddesdon (ferry)
13. Hoddesdon → Bath (plane)
14. Bath → Preston (plane)
15. Preston → Tamworth (ferry)
16. Tamworth → Amiens (plane)
17. Amiens → Simi Valley (ferry)
18. Simi Valley → Loughborough (ferry)
19. Loughborough → Warsaw (ferry)
20. Warsaw → Irvine (plane)
21. Irvine → Barnaul (train)
22. Barnaul → Berlin (ferry)
23. Berlin → Swift Current (bus)
24. Swift Current → Solihull (bus)
25. Solihull → Mostar (plane)
26. Mostar → Lisbon (ferry)
27. Lisbon → Bromley (ferry)
28. Bromley → Kent (train)
29. Kent → Limoges (train)
30. Limoges → Thatcham (bus)
31. Thatcham → Argenteuil (bus)
32. Argenteuil → Marseille (bus)
33. Marseille → Barrie (bus)
34. Barrie → Southend (ferry)
35. Southend → Bratislava (bus)
36. Bratislava → Little Rock (train)
37. Little Rock → Bucharest (ferry)
38. Bucharest → Huddersfield (plane)
39. Huddersfield → Tampa (train)

Yes, that seems to be the correct path. Each step follows the one-way connections as given. I need to make sure there are no loops or missed steps. Let me check each transition again to confirm. For example, from Huddersfield to Tampa is a direct train. So the final step is correct. The entire route from Krakow to Tampa is 39 steps long, but according to the problem statement, each city connects to only one other, so the path is unique. I'll list each step in the required format.
