Okay, let's see. I need to find the route from Cheboksary to Lubbock. Each city connects to only one other city via a specific transit method. So I'll start at Cheboksary and follow the connections step by step.

First, Cheboksary is connected to Rochester by plane. So the first step is taking a plane from Cheboksary to Rochester. Now, Rochester's connection is to Chichester by bus. Next step: bus from Rochester to Chichester. Chichester connects to Hitchin by plane. So plane to Hitchin. Hitchin goes to Oakland by plane. Then Oakland to Nashville by plane. Nashville connects to Moscow by bus. Moscow to Bielefeld by bus. Bielefeld to Minneapolis by plane. Minneapolis to Norfolk by plane. Norfolk to Sacramento by ferry. Sacramento to Maribor by bus. Maribor to Lille by train. Lille to Orlando by train. Orlando to Timmins by plane. Timmins to Izhevsk by plane. Izhevsk to Cedar Rapids by ferry. Cedar Rapids to Wuppertal by ferry. Wuppertal to Bremen by bus. Bremen to Makhachkala by train. Makhachkala to Rennes by ferry. Rennes to Catania by train. Catania to Concord by ferry. Concord to Bletchley by plane. Bletchley to Abingdon by ferry. Abingdon to Lviv by ferry. Lviv to Chelmsford by bus. Chelmsford to Chisinau by plane. Chisinau to Raleigh by plane. Raleigh to Reykjavik by bus. Reykjavik to Plovdiv by train. Plovdiv to Workington by plane. Workington to Lipetsk by plane. Lipetsk to Peoria by bus. And finally, Peoria to Lubbock by train. That should be the end. Let me check each step again to make sure I didn't skip any or make a mistake. Yeah, each connection follows correctly. So the route is all those steps in order.
